# Agentic Language Development — Implementation Backlog

This backlog translates `SPECIFICATION.md`, `EXPERIMENT-NOTEBOOK.md`, and `LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md` into an implementation-grade, dependency-ordered plan. It is a derived planning artifact, not a normative source: where this document and the three source documents disagree, the source documents win and this backlog must be corrected.

## 1. Document Status

- **Status:** Implementation active, with 169 of 240 acceptance criteria verified. The verifiable core and Prototype Mode pipeline are joined by tested Phase E foundations for alternate carriers and affect, frozen/self-supervised/hybrid adapters, fail-closed scenario quarantine and observation red-teaming, process and container isolation, telemetry, snapshot/restore, failure handling, retention enforcement, held-out scenario splits, fixed-schedule curriculum execution, verifier-bound live causal probes, and recoverable bounded repair turns. The acceptance checkboxes below are authoritative: the active side-channel harness, real open weights, funded Base anchoring, complete Research-Grade training/key isolation, and external pre-registration remain open.
- **Source of truth precedence:** `SPECIFICATION.md` governs implementation; `LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md` governs ledger, checkpoint, Merkle, and anchoring mechanics; `EXPERIMENT-NOTEBOOK.md` governs experiment pre-registration and results; `CONCEPT-IDEA.md` preserves research rationale. This backlog is derived from those documents and introduces no new normative requirements.
- **Scope of this backlog:** software and process engineering work required to stand up the system described in `SPECIFICATION.md` and to make every experiment in `EXPERIMENT-NOTEBOOK.md` §7–§8 executable. It does **not** include running the experiments themselves, interpreting results, or drafting findings — those are research-execution activities tracked in the notebook, not software backlog items.
- **Numbering:** Epics use stable IDs `EPIC-01`…`EPIC-15`. Individual backlog items use stable IDs `ALD-001`…`ALD-080`. IDs are assigned in dependency order: every item's `Depends on` list only ever references a **lower**-numbered ALD ID. IDs are permanent once assigned and must not be reused or renumbered by future edits; new work gets the next unused ID appended at the end of its epic's range or a new epic.

## 2. Planning Assumptions

- **Runtime and language:** Node.js with TypeScript, consistent with the DTSF ecosystem this project builds on. Package management is npm, using npm workspaces for a monorepo layout (no Yarn/pnpm).
- **Evidence store:** SQLite in WAL (write-ahead log) mode is the authoritative local evidence store, per `LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md` [§18. Recommended Initial Decision](LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md#18-recommended-initial-decision). No external database is introduced.
- **Anchoring chain:** Base Sepolia (testnet) is the first and default anchoring target. Mainnet anchoring is a separate, later, explicitly opt-in capability — never the default.
- **Model default:** `scratch-rl` is the primary scientific baseline. A local open-weight `frozen-llm` is the orchestration-validation default; `self-supervised` is the initial reward-free comparison. `no-learning` and `hybrid` are explicit controls/variants.
- **Isolation:** Research-Grade Mode (Mode R) runs learner processes in separate containers/processes with no shared mutable state beyond the Gateway and ledger, per `SPECIFICATION.md` [§5.2 Research-Grade Mode (Mode R)](SPECIFICATION.md#52-research-grade-mode-mode-r).
- **On-chain privacy:** no private, raw-observation, or model-internal data is ever placed in an on-chain anchoring payload — only checkpoint root hashes and minimal metadata, per `SPECIFICATION.md` [§13.6 Privacy Controls](SPECIFICATION.md#136-privacy-controls) and `LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md` [§12. Privacy](LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md#12-privacy).
- **No invented dates or staffing:** this backlog contains no calendar dates, durations, or headcount figures. Milestones are ordinal (`M0`…`M5`); the execution plan uses ordinal iterations (`Iteration 1`…`Iteration 4`, "Iteration 5+"). Sequencing is expressed purely through dependencies.
- **Repository today:** an npm-workspaces TypeScript monorepo with the packages listed in README.md; each item's acceptance criteria assume only what earlier, lower-numbered ALD items established.
- **Diplomacy-table reuse:** the repository's existing UX components (e.g., from a prior Diplomacy-style project) may be reused only within the boundaries `SPECIFICATION.md` [§16.2](SPECIFICATION.md#162-diplomacy-table-reuse-boundaries) defines; this is treated as a constraint, not an invitation to reuse everything available.

## 3. Priority Definitions

Priority indicates *what breaks the claim boundary or blocks the critical path if delayed*, not simple business value. Priority is orthogonal to the MVP / Research-Grade / Later-Research classification used on each item (see §4 and item template in §12).

- **P0 — Safety, integrity, or critical path.** Evidence integrity (hashing, signing, atomicity, Merkle/checkpointing, verifier CLI), the run/turn state machine, integrity-fork detection/recovery, observation hygiene and isolation controls, Gateway core validation/rejection behavior, claim-boundary enforcement, and pre-registration binding. If a P0 item is wrong or missing, either the system can silently violate its own integrity claims, or no later work can proceed at all.
- **P1 — Core capability and research-grade readiness.** Model/learner adapters beyond the minimal path, Mode R isolation mechanics, telemetry/audit, the dashboard MVP, the mainnet anchoring *path* (not its activation), and documentation/operations. Required to run real studies credibly, but a delay does not corrupt evidence or silently break claims.
- **P2 — Advanced carriers, negotiation, cryptography research, or operational polish.** Generative-carrier and six-display-affect channels beyond the fixed-token baseline, cooperative-vs-negotiation scenario variants, the ephemeral-encoding/cryptography research harness, mainnet activation itself, and UX/console refinements. These extend research reach but are not required for the first credible, integrity-checked study.

A P0 item can still be classified `Later-Research` (e.g., the cryptographic novelty-vs-security separation policy is P0 because it protects the integrity system, but it is only operationally exercised once `E40` work begins).

## 4. Sizing Scale

Sizing is relative-complexity based, not calendar-based (no velocity or team-size baseline exists yet).

- **S (Small):** a single component, interface, or schema change, verifiable in isolation with a narrow test surface.
- **M (Medium):** one service/subsystem touching a small number of integration points (e.g., one schema plus its persistence and one consumer).
- **L (Large):** cross-service work or a new subsystem with multiple integration points and its own dedicated test surface (e.g., a new protocol channel, a new twin pack, a CLI tool).
- **XL:** reserved for **epics/themes only**. No individual `ALD-XXX` item is ever sized XL — if an epic-level theme is XL, it must be broken into S/M/L stories before work starts (this is exactly what §12 does for every epic in this backlog).

## 5. Workflow States

Every backlog item moves through: `Backlog` → `Ready` → `In Progress` → `In Review` → `Verification` → `Done`, with a `Blocked` side-state reachable from any non-`Done` state.

- **Backlog:** captured, not yet meeting the Definition of Ready.
- **Ready:** meets the Definition of Ready (§6); may be pulled into progress.
- **In Progress:** actively being implemented.
- **In Review:** implementation complete, undergoing code/design review.
- **Verification:** review passed; acceptance criteria being run (tests, conformance suites, gate checks, or — for security items — red-team execution).
- **Done:** meets the Definition of Done (§7).
- **Blocked:** cannot proceed; the blocking dependency or decision must be recorded on the item.

## 6. Definition of Ready

An item may enter `In Progress` only when:

- It cites at least one `SPECIFICATION.md` (or `LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md` / `EXPERIMENT-NOTEBOOK.md`) section as its normative source.
- Every item in its `Depends on` list is `Done`, or the dependency is explicitly waived in writing on the item with a stated reason.
- Its acceptance criteria are stated as testable, falsifiable statements (already true for every item in §12 as written).
- Priority, size, and classification (MVP / Research-Grade / Later-Research) are assigned.
- For any item touching evidence integrity, anchoring, or isolation (P0 safety-tagged items), the relevant source-document section has been re-read by the implementer in full, not skimmed.

## 7. Definition of Done

An item may move to `Done` only when:

- All of its acceptance criteria are demonstrated true, with the demonstration method recorded (test name, CLI run, or manual verification log).
- Automated tests covering the acceptance criteria exist and pass in CI (once `ALD-078` exists; before that, tests pass locally and are checked into the same change).
- No known regression is introduced in previously-`Done` items' acceptance criteria (verified by re-running their tests, not by inspection).
- Documentation directly affected by the change is updated in the same change (README, API reference, or the operations runbook once `ALD-079` exists).
- For items feeding an Experiment Readiness Gate (§13), the gate's checklist entry for that item is checked off with a link to the passing evidence, not just implied by the item being `Done`.
- The change does not modify `SPECIFICATION.md`, `EXPERIMENT-NOTEBOOK.md`, or `LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md` — those are read-only inputs to this backlog.

## 8. Release and Milestone Roadmap

Milestones are ordinal and gate-based, not date-based. Each milestone's exit gate is a specific, testable state of specific `ALD-XXX` items, not a calendar target. The milestone sequence loosely mirrors `LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md` [§16. Implementation Phases](LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md#16-implementation-phases) for the evidence/anchoring spine, extended to cover the whole system.

### M0 — Foundations
- **Epics in scope:** EPIC-01 (`ALD-001`–`004`), EPIC-02 (`ALD-005`–`011`).
- **Entry gate:** none (starting point).
- **Exit gate:** `ALD-011` crash-safety tests pass — the hash-chained, WAL-mode evidence store survives induced mid-write crashes with no torn writes. Corresponds to `LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md` [Phase 0: Local Integrity](LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md#phase-0-local-integrity).

### M1 — Verifiable Core
- **Epics in scope:** EPIC-03 (`ALD-012`–`017`), EPIC-05 (`ALD-023`–`028`).
- **Entry gate:** M0 exit met.
- **Exit gate:** `ALD-015` independently validates a real exported bundle, `ALD-027` detects integrity forks, and `ALD-028` proves immutable derived-run lineage. Corresponds to `LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md` [Phase 1: Merkle Proofs](LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md#phase-1-merkle-proofs).

### M2 — Communication and Learners MVP
- **Epics in scope:** EPIC-06 core (`ALD-029`–`030`, `034`–`036`), EPIC-07 (`ALD-037`–`041`), EPIC-08 MVP tracks (`ALD-042`–`045`), EPIC-09 (`ALD-048`–`052`).
- **Entry gate:** M1 exit met.
- **Exit gate:** `ALD-036` fixed-token Gateway conformance suite is green across the full baby-a/baby-b/nursery route set (`ALD-052`), with the no-learning reference (`ALD-042`), frozen-LLM (`ALD-044`), and scratch-RL (`ALD-045`) tracks completing full turns end-to-end.

### M3 — Research-Grade Isolation and Anchoring
- **Epics in scope:** EPIC-04 testnet path (`ALD-018`–`021`), EPIC-10 (`ALD-053`–`057`), EPIC-11 core (`ALD-058`–`060`), EPIC-13 red-team suites (`ALD-067`–`068`), and EPIC-14 foundations/Gate G1 (`ALD-071`–`073`).
- **Entry gate:** M2 exit met.
- **Exit gate:** Mode R isolation, Base Sepolia anchoring, red-team suites, snapshot/restore, and Gate G1 all pass. Corresponds to `LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md` [Phase 2: Testnet Anchoring](LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md#phase-2-testnet-anchoring).

### M4 — Console, Advanced Carriers, and Gate Coverage
- **Epics in scope:** EPIC-06 remaining (`ALD-031`–`033`), EPIC-08 remaining (`ALD-046`–`047`), EPIC-11 remaining (`ALD-061`–`062`), EPIC-12 (`ALD-063`–`066`), EPIC-14 Gates G2-G4 (`ALD-074`–`076`).
- **Entry gate:** M3 exit met.
- **Exit gate:** `ALD-063` dashboard/research console MVP is live and readiness Gates G2-G4 (`ALD-074`–`076`) pass; G1 remains green from M3.

### M5 — Public Anchoring, Cryptography Research, and Release
- **Epics in scope:** EPIC-04 mainnet switch (`ALD-022`), EPIC-13 remaining (`ALD-069`–`070`), EPIC-14 Gate G5 (`ALD-077`), EPIC-15 (`ALD-078`–`080`).
- **Entry gate:** M4 exit met.
- **Exit gate:** Gate G5 (`ALD-077`) passes, `ALD-078` CI is green on the full consolidated suite, and `ALD-080` release/publication mapping is complete. Corresponds to `LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md` [Phase 3: Public Anchoring](LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md#phase-3-public-anchoring).

**Critical path across milestones:** M0 → M1 → M2 → M3 → M4 → M5 is a strict chain — each milestone's epics depend on the previous milestone's evidence/lifecycle foundations. Within M2–M4, epics not named in the critical-path narrative (§10) can proceed in parallel once their own dependencies clear; see §10 for the detailed item-level view.

## 10. Dependency and Critical Path View

### 10.1 The P0 integrity-and-lifecycle spine

The following chain is the longest dependency path through P0 items — the sequence that gates everything else. Items are shown in dependency order; each depends (directly or transitively) on the one before it.

```
ALD-001 → ALD-002 → ALD-005 → ALD-006 → ALD-007 → ALD-008 → ALD-010 → ALD-011
   → ALD-012 → ALD-013 → ALD-015                                  (verifiable core)
ALD-023 → ALD-024 → ALD-025 → ALD-026 / ALD-027 / ALD-028         (lifecycle)
ALD-029 → ALD-030 → ALD-034 → ALD-036                              (gateway conformance)
ALD-037 → ALD-038 / ALD-039 → ALD-040                               (hygiene)
ALD-042 → ALD-043 → ALD-048 → ALD-049 → ALD-051                   (twins + auth)
ALD-053 → ALD-054                                                    (claim boundary)
ALD-071 → ALD-073 (Gate G1)                                         (first experiment readiness gate)
```

No item off this spine can reach `Done` status meaningfully ahead of its position here, because every later epic (EPIC-06 onward) depends on EPIC-02 and EPIC-05 being functional first.

### 10.2 Items explicitly on the critical path

| ALD ID | Why it is critical-path | Consequence if delayed |
|---|---|---|
| ALD-008 | Hash chaining underlies every later integrity guarantee | Merkle checkpoints (ALD-012) and verifier CLI (ALD-015) cannot start |
| ALD-010 | Atomic transaction wrapper is required by the turn orchestrator | ALD-025 (turn orchestrator) cannot be built correctly |
| ALD-015 | Independent verifier CLI is the first end-to-end proof the integrity design works | Gate G1 (ALD-073) and all anchoring work (EPIC-04) are unverifiable |
| ALD-024 | Run state machine is required by every route and every experiment | Nursery routes (ALD-049), Mode switch (ALD-053), and all gates block |
| ALD-029 | Gateway is the single mediation point for all communication | No protocol (ALD-030/031/033) or twin route (ALD-048) can be wired |
| ALD-048 / ALD-049 | Twin packs are the only way any learner or researcher interacts with the system | Dashboard (EPIC-12), Mode R (EPIC-10), and all gates (EPIC-14) block |
| ALD-071 | Pre-registration binding gates every subsequent experiment readiness gate | Gates G1–G5 (ALD-073–077) cannot be defined as "readiness," only as ad hoc capability |

### 10.3 Parallelizable branches

Once EPIC-02 (`ALD-011`) and EPIC-05 (`ALD-024`) are `Done`, the following branches can proceed **concurrently**, each only depending on the spine above and on items within its own branch:

- **Anchoring branch (EPIC-04):** depends only on EPIC-03, not on EPIC-06/07/08/09.
- **Gateway/protocol branch (EPIC-06) and Hygiene/scenario branch (EPIC-07):** depend on EPIC-05 but not on each other except where noted (`ALD-040` depends on both `ALD-029` and `ALD-037`).
- **Learner adapter branch (EPIC-08):** depends on EPIC-07 (`ALD-037`) but the four adapter tracks (`ALD-044`–`047`) are mutually independent and can be built in parallel by different owners.
- **Security/red-team branch (EPIC-13) items `ALD-067`/`068`:** depend on EPIC-07 and EPIC-10 respectively but not on each other, and not on EPIC-11/12.
- **Telemetry/audit branch (EPIC-11) and Dashboard branch (EPIC-12):** EPIC-11 can start as soon as EPIC-05 and EPIC-02 are done; EPIC-12 must wait on EPIC-11's telemetry (`ALD-058`) and EPIC-09's routes (`ALD-050`).

## 11. First 4 Iterations Execution Plan

Iterations are ordinal, not calendar-based. Each iteration lists parallel workstreams.
Items within one workstream remain dependency-ordered and may start after an earlier
item in the same iteration is complete; an item never starts before all of its listed
dependencies are complete.

### Iteration 1 — Foundations
- **Workstream A (Evidence and Integrity):** `ALD-001`, `ALD-002`, `ALD-003`, `ALD-005`, `ALD-006`, `ALD-007`.
- **Workstream B (Scaffolding):** `ALD-004`.
- **Exit state:** monorepo builds; twin pack skeletons exist; evidence schema, canonicalization, and event-type validation are implemented (not yet chained/signed/atomic).

### Iteration 2 — Chaining, Atomicity, and Checkpoints
- **Workstream A (Evidence and Integrity):** `ALD-008`, `ALD-009`, `ALD-010`, `ALD-011`.
- **Workstream B (Verification):** `ALD-012`, `ALD-013`, `ALD-014`.
- **Workstream C (Lifecycle):** `ALD-023`, `ALD-024`.
- **Exit state:** hash-chained, signed, atomic, crash-safe evidence store; checkpoint manifests generated on schedule; run configuration and run state machine operational.

### Iteration 3 — Verifier, Gateway, and First Adapters
- **Workstream A (Verification):** `ALD-015`, `ALD-016`, `ALD-017`.
- **Workstream B (Lifecycle):** `ALD-025`, `ALD-026`, `ALD-027`, `ALD-028`.
- **Workstream C (Gateway and Protocols):** `ALD-029`, `ALD-030`, `ALD-034`, `ALD-035`, `ALD-036`.
- **Workstream D (Observation and Scenario Core):** `ALD-037`, `ALD-041`, sequenced after `ALD-025`.
- **Workstream E (Adapters):** `ALD-042`, `ALD-043`, `ALD-044`, `ALD-045`, sequenced after `ALD-037`.
- **Exit state:** independent verifier CLI functions against exported bundles; turn orchestrator with pause/abort/recovery, integrity-fork detection, and derived-run lineage is complete; fixed-token conformance is green; deterministic observations and scenarios are available; no-learning, frozen-LLM, and scratch-RL adapters complete full turns.

### Iteration 4 — Twins, Hygiene, Anchoring, and First Gate
- **Workstream A (Twins and API):** `ALD-048`, `ALD-049`, `ALD-050`, `ALD-051`, `ALD-052`.
- **Workstream B (Hygiene and Side Channels):** `ALD-038`, `ALD-039`, `ALD-040`.
- **Workstream C (Anchoring):** `ALD-018`, `ALD-019`, `ALD-020`, `ALD-021`.
- **Workstream D (Mode R):** `ALD-053`, `ALD-054`, `ALD-055`, sequenced after `ALD-049`.
- **Workstream E (Security and Gates):** `ALD-067`, `ALD-068`, `ALD-071`, `ALD-072`, `ALD-073`, sequenced after their Mode R, hygiene, anchoring, scenario, and pre-registration dependencies.
- **Workstream F (Audit and Recovery):** `ALD-058`, `ALD-059`, `ALD-060`, sequenced after lifecycle, evidence, and Mode R dependencies.
- **Exit state:** baby-a/baby-b/nursery routes live with authorization and standardized error shape; observation hygiene, sanitization, and seeded scenario determinism operational; Base Sepolia anchoring confirmed; Gate G1 (E00–E03 readiness) achievable.

**Iteration 5+ (not detailed further here, no dates implied):** continues with the remaining branches — generative carrier and affect protocols (`ALD-031`–033), remaining adapter tracks (`ALD-046`–047), Mode R isolation and telemetry/audit/retention (EPIC-10, EPIC-11), the dashboard (EPIC-12), remaining security/crypto items (`ALD-069`–070), Gates G2–G5 (`ALD-074`–077), and CI/documentation/release (EPIC-15) — in the dependency order fixed by their IDs.

## 12. Backlog Items by Epic

Each item lists: Priority, Size, Classification (MVP / Research-Grade / Later-Research), Depends on, Spec/Experiment references, Scope, and Acceptance Criteria. Checkboxes are used only on acceptance-criteria bullets for these executable items.

### EPIC-01 — Repository and Project Scaffolding

**Goal:** stand up the monorepo, shared types, configuration convention, and twin pack skeletons so every later epic has a place to put code. **Depends on:** none. **Acceptance gate:** the monorepo installs and builds with zero source packages beyond skeletons, and a skeleton twin pack responds on its unprefixed route.

#### ALD-001 — npm workspaces monorepo bootstrap
- **Priority:** P0 · **Size:** M · **Class:** MVP · **Depends on:** none
- **Spec refs:** `SPECIFICATION.md` [§4.1 Components](SPECIFICATION.md#41-components)
- **Scope:** Initialize root `package.json` with `workspaces` for `packages/*` and `twins/*`; set up shared TypeScript config, lint/format config, and a root build script (`tsc --build` across project references).
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] `npm install` at the repo root succeeds with zero workspace packages beyond the initial skeletons.
  - [x] `npm run build` (project references) compiles with zero errors.
  - [x] A new package can be added under `packages/*` and is automatically picked up by the workspace without editing the root `package.json`.

#### ALD-002 — Shared `@ald/types` schema package
- **Priority:** P0 · **Size:** M · **Class:** MVP · **Depends on:** ALD-001
- **Spec refs:** `SPECIFICATION.md` [§11 Data Schemas and Interfaces](SPECIFICATION.md#11-data-schemas-and-interfaces)
- **Scope:** Create a `packages/types` package exporting TypeScript types/interfaces (or a schema-validation library's schema objects) for every data structure named in `SPECIFICATION.md` §11 (Run Configuration, Observation, Agent Action Proposal, Ledger Event, Channel Event, Affect Event, Checkpoint Manifest Reference, Anchor Receipt Reference, Experiment Record, Verification Report) as empty/skeleton shapes to be filled in by the epics that own them.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] One exported type/schema exists per §11 subsection (§11.1–§11.10), named to match the section title.
  - [x] The package builds and is importable from any other workspace package.
  - [x] A schema-drift test fails if a §11 subsection type is removed without the corresponding source-doc section also changing (a lightweight manifest of expected export names is checked in CI once `ALD-078` exists, and locally before then).

#### ALD-003 — Environment, configuration, and secrets convention
- **Priority:** P1 · **Size:** S · **Class:** MVP · **Depends on:** ALD-001
- **Spec refs:** `SPECIFICATION.md` [§5. Deployment Modes and Claim Boundaries](SPECIFICATION.md#5-deployment-modes-and-claim-boundaries)
- **Scope:** Define the environment-variable and config-file convention used across all packages (e.g., `DTSF_PORT`, mode switch variable, key-material file paths). No secrets are ever committed; document the convention in a `CONFIGURATION.md` or equivalent.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] A documented list of all environment variables exists with defaults and types.
  - [x] Loading config with a required variable missing fails fast with a clear error, not a silent default.
  - [x] No secret-shaped value (private key, API token) appears in any committed file; a scan step verifies this.

- **Scope:** Create three twin pack skeletons (`baby-a`, `baby-b`, `nursery`) with `twin.yaml` manifests, empty `behavior/pack.ts`, and a placeholder route returning `501 Not Implemented`, following the DTSF convention that **route patterns never include the twin-name prefix** (the runtime's `/:twinName/*` route strips it before dispatch).
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] All three twin packs load without error when the DTSF runtime scans `twins/packs/`.
  - [x] Every registered route pattern in all three packs starts with `/`, not `/baby-a`, `/baby-b`, or `/nursery`.
  - [x] A request to `/baby-a/<placeholder-route>` reaches the handler with `req.params[0]` equal to the unprefixed path, confirmed by an integration test.

- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] Database is created with `journal_mode=WAL` confirmed via `PRAGMA journal_mode`.
  - [x] Every table in §13.1 exists, and event/audit/experiment tables have triggers rejecting `UPDATE` and `DELETE` while versioned records append new rows.
  - [x] Running the migration twice is idempotent, and an automated test proves privileged application code cannot bypass the append-only triggers.

- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] Serializing the same logical event twice, in two different process runs, produces byte-identical output.
  - [x] Key order in the serialized form is independent of the key insertion order of the input object.
  - [x] A round-trip (serialize → deserialize) produces a deep-equal object to the input.

#### ALD-007 — Event type registry and validators

  - [x] Every committed event and checkpoint has a signature verifiable by the public key registered for exactly its domain.
  - [x] Cross-domain signing attempts fail, including Baby A attempting to sign Baby B or channel content.
  - [x] Private keys are absent from SQLite, logs, model context, and evidence bundles; per-run rotation produces distinct public keys.

- **Spec refs:** `SPECIFICATION.md` [§8.2 Atomic Ledger+Message Transaction](SPECIFICATION.md#82-atomic-ledgermessage-transaction)
- **Scope:** Implement the single Evidence Writer service from SPECIFICATION §4/§8: authenticate Gateway requests, assign sequences, build canonical events, obtain domain-bound signatures from `ALD-009`, and commit the sender ledger plus channel event in one SQLite transaction.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] A signing or insert failure at any point results in zero sender-ledger and channel rows committed.
  - [x] A successful `TurnCommitRequest` commits both signed rows atomically and returns their entry hashes before delivery.
  - [x] Module boundaries and database permissions prevent every other component, including Gateway and Controller, from writing event tables directly.

#### ALD-011 — WAL durability and crash-safety tests
- **Priority:** P0 · **Size:** M · **Class:** MVP · **Depends on:** ALD-005, ALD-010
- **Spec refs:** `LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md` [§3. Authoritative Local Store](LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md#3-authoritative-local-store), [§15. Recovery and Fork Handling](LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md#15-recovery-and-fork-handling)
- **Scope:** Build a test harness that kills the process mid-write (simulated crash) and verifies the WAL recovers to a consistent last-committed state on restart, with no torn or partial ledger events.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] Simulated crash during an in-flight `ALD-010` transaction leaves the database with either the pre-transaction or post-transaction state, never a partial one, on restart.
  - [x] The chain-walk validator from `ALD-008` reports zero integrity violations after each crash-recovery test run.
  - [ ] The test suite runs at least 20 randomized crash-point trials in CI (once `ALD-078` exists) without a single torn-write failure.

**Goal:** build ordered Merkle checkpoints, an evidence bundle export, and an independent verifier CLI, matching `LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md` Phase 1. **Depends on:** EPIC-02. **Acceptance gate:** `ALD-015` verifier CLI validates a real exported bundle end-to-end.

#### ALD-012 — Ordered Merkle trees and consistency proofs

- **Scope:** Implement RFC 6962-style ordered Merkle trees for all present primary and auxiliary event domains, producing roots, inclusion proofs, and prefix-consistency proofs between checkpoint sizes.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] Given a fixed ordered set of event hashes, the builder produces a deterministic, reproducible root hash.
  - [x] An inclusion proof for any leaf verifies correctly against the root using only the proof and the leaf hash.

- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] A generated manifest validates against the authoritative schema and includes every event tree present in the Evidence Store.
  - [x] Each manifest references the immediately prior checkpoint hash and carries a valid Nursery witness signature.
  - [x] Every tree size/root exactly matches `ALD-012`, and a missing or extra tree causes checkpoint generation to fail.

#### ALD-014 — Checkpoint frequency scheduler
- **Priority:** P1 · **Size:** S · **Class:** MVP · **Depends on:** ALD-013
- **Spec refs:** `LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md` [§9. Checkpoint Frequency](LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md#9-checkpoint-frequency)

- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] A checkpoint is generated automatically once the configured trigger threshold from §9 is reached.
  - [x] No two checkpoints overlap in event range.
  - [ ] The scheduler is a background timer with the crash-protection convention (registered under the process's `uncaughtException`/`unhandledRejection` handlers) so a scheduling failure logs rather than crashes the server.

#### ALD-015 — Independent verifier CLI
- **Priority:** P0 · **Size:** L · **Class:** MVP · **Depends on:** ALD-012, ALD-013, ALD-009
- **Spec refs:** `LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md` [§14. Independent Verification](LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md#14-independent-verification)

Chain-RPC verification is added by `ALD-021`.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] The CLI runs against an exported bundle with no network access and no shared process state with the server.
  - [x] It accepts an unchanged local bundle and rejects every non-chain mutation case in LEDGER §17 with the correct machine-readable failure location.

- **Scope:** Formalize the CLI's pass/fail output into the Verification Report structure defined in §11.10 and persist generated reports alongside the bundle they describe.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] Every verifier CLI run (`ALD-015`) produces a report conforming to the `ALD-002` schema for Verification Report.
  - [x] A failing verification produces a report with machine-readable failure codes, not just free text.
  - [ ] Reports are timestamped and reference the exact bundle export they were generated from.

- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] A stored Anchor Receipt validates against the `ALD-002` schema and always references an existing checkpoint manifest (`ALD-013`).

- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] The anchoring key is stored separately from the event-signing key and neither can be derived from the other.
  - [x] A key-rotation procedure exists and is exercised by a test that anchors before and after rotation without breaking prior receipts' validity.
  - [x] The anchoring private key is never logged, telemetered, or included in any evidence bundle.

- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [ ] A submitted checkpoint root is independently observable on a public Base Sepolia block explorer.
  - [x] The default configuration anchors to Base Sepolia with no additional opt-in required.

- **Scope:** Implement finality polling and retry/backoff, then extend the independent verifier to retrieve the transaction through an independently configured RPC, validate chain ID/calldata/receipt/block inclusion, and compare the anchored checkpoint to the final local prefix.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] A receipt is marked `confirmed` only after reaching the configured confirmation depth.
  - [x] Transient RPC failure retries without duplicate submission; wrong-chain, failed, or nonexistent transactions fail verification.
  - [x] The verifier reports any event tail after the final anchored checkpoint and independently reproduces the anchored checkpoint hash.

#### ALD-022 — Mainnet anchoring policy switch
- **Priority:** P2 · **Size:** M · **Class:** Later-Research · **Depends on:** ALD-020, ALD-021, ALD-003
- **Spec refs:** `SPECIFICATION.md` [§13.4 Base Sepolia / Mainnet Anchoring Policy](SPECIFICATION.md#134-base-sepolia--mainnet-anchoring-policy)
- **Scope:** Add an explicit, separately-configured mainnet anchoring path reusing the Sepolia client's logic with a different chain configuration, gated behind a distinct opt-in flag that defaults to off.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] With no explicit opt-in set, the system never submits any transaction to mainnet, confirmed by a test that asserts zero mainnet RPC calls under default config.
  - [ ] Enabling the opt-in flag and providing mainnet-specific key/config anchors successfully to mainnet in a manual/staging test.
  - [x] Switching the opt-in flag off again immediately reverts all anchoring to Base Sepolia with no code change required.

### EPIC-05 — Run and Turn Lifecycle State Machine

- **Scope:** Implement the turn-phase sequencing (observation → proposal → validation → commit, per §8.1) driving the `ALD-010` atomic transaction wrapper at the commit phase, enforcing the timing budgets from §8.3.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] Every phase in §8.1 executes in the documented order for a successful turn.
  - [x] A turn exceeding the §8.3 timing budget is terminated and recorded as a timeout, not left hanging.
  - [x] The commit phase always goes through the `ALD-010` atomic wrapper — no direct ledger writes bypass it.

#### ALD-026 — Pause/abort handling
- **Priority:** P0 · **Size:** S · **Class:** MVP · **Depends on:** ALD-024
- **Spec refs:** `SPECIFICATION.md` [§7.3 Pause/Abort/Recovery/Fork Behavior](SPECIFICATION.md#73-pause-abort-recovery-fork-behavior)
- **Scope:** Implement pause and abort operations that transition a run to the corresponding §7.1 states, ensuring an in-flight turn either completes its atomic commit or is fully rolled back before the pause/abort takes effect.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] Pausing a run mid-turn either lets the current turn's atomic commit finish or fully rolls it back — never a partial commit.
  - [x] An `aborted-sealed` run is terminal and can never accept another turn or be reopened.
  - [x] Pause/abort/resume operations are recorded through the audited intervention path and produce required checkpoints.

- **Scope:** Reconstruct run/turn state from the last consistent evidence prefix after restart, and detect duplicate `(runId, domain, sequence)` entries with mismatched hashes both during writes and recovery.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] After a simulated crash mid-turn, restart reconstructs the run's state to exactly the last atomically committed turn, with no phantom in-progress turn.
  - [x] A mismatched duplicate sequence preserves both artifacts, transitions the run to `forked-invalid`, halts writes, and requires research-integrity review.
  - [x] Recovery appends an explicit recovery event at the next unused sequence and matches the state independently derived by `ALD-015`.

#### ALD-028 — Derived-run branching and lineage
- **Priority:** P1 · **Size:** M · **Class:** Research-Grade · **Depends on:** ALD-024, ALD-016

- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [ ] A child run records `parentRunId`, `derivedFromCheckpointHash`, and both initial policy refs in config and its first initialization event.
  - [x] Child sequences restart at `1`, and writes never modify parent evidence or reopen a terminal parent.
  - [ ] `ALD-016` exports lineage references and `ALD-015` verifies them against the immutable parent bundle.

- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] Every artifact passes through the Gateway; direct Baby-to-Baby routes fail in an instrumented integration test.
  - [x] `normal`, `disabled`, `constant`, seeded `random`, seeded `shuffled`, and E03-only `oracle` conditions produce their exact §9.6 behavior with no code changes.
  - [x] Every accepted, rejected, or control-substituted turn records the Baby-proposal hash when present and exact delivered-artifact hash through `ALD-035`.

#### ALD-030 — Fixed-token protocol

- **Scope:** Implement §9.2's `fixed-glyph`, `generative-bitmap`, `generative-canvas`, and `generative-tone` carrier modules with frozen neutral grammars, hard bounds, RFC 8785 canonicalization, and carrier-qualified content-addressed `markHash` generation.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] Each alternate carrier accepts a valid bounded artifact and reproduces the same carrier-qualified `markHash`.
  - [x] Out-of-range glyph IDs, bitmap sizes, stroke values, tone bins, text/color fields, and semantic tags are rejected with specific reasons.
  - [x] Every carrier contributes accept/reject vectors to `ALD-036`, and exactly one carrier family is available in a run.

- **Scope:** Add offline evaluation hooks for measuring whether alternate-carrier artifacts reproduce recognizable human-language forms or encode task/referent information through unintended glyph, bitmap, stroke, or tone features. The evaluator reports evidence and claim-boundary impact; it does not silently rewrite accepted artifacts.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [ ] The evaluator records mark-level leakage metrics and the exact analysis version in the run evidence bundle.
  - [ ] Pre-registered recognizable-glyph and unintended-feature probes produce explicit pass, fail, or inconclusive results without altering the original canvas artifact.
  - [ ] A failed leakage evaluation blocks an ungrounded-language claim while preserving the run as valid negative or integrity evidence.

#### ALD-033 — Six-display affect protocol
- **Priority:** P2 · **Size:** M · **Class:** Later-Research · **Depends on:** ALD-029
- **Spec refs:** `SPECIFICATION.md` [§9.3 Six-Display Affect Protocol](SPECIFICATION.md#93-six-display-affect-protocol)
- **Scope:** Implement declared, permuted, opaque, and derived six-display modes plus emergent-affect routing through the selected alternate carrier. In derived mode, the Gateway maps adapter measurements; the Baby cannot choose a display.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] Declared/permuted/opaque modes emit only A1-A6, while any other display or out-of-window submission is rejected.
  - [x] Derived mode disables `submit_affect`, records the private measurement, and applies the pre-registered Gateway mapping; emergent mode records a carrier Channel Event rather than an Affect Event.
  - [x] Affect schemas and every mode's accept/reject vectors extend `ALD-036`, including normalized timing/envelope behavior.

- **Scope:** Implement the protocol-independent rejection framework used by every Gateway module: consistent error shape, append-only `channel.rejected` events containing only a rejected-payload hash, rejection counters, and automatic pause after the configured consecutive-rejection ceiling. Fixed-token handling is the first registered module; later canvas and affect modules reuse this framework.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] A fixed-token violation produces the standard rejection shape and an append-only `channel.rejected` event with reason code and payload hash but no raw rejected content.
  - [x] Five consecutive rejections by default trigger an automatic pause and `safety-trigger` audit entry.
  - [x] A protocol-module contract test proves canvas and affect handlers can register later without changing the rejection event shape or pause policy.

- **Scope:** Implement and validate Agent Action Proposal, Turn Proposal Envelope, Ledger Draft Envelope, Affect State Measurement, and fully signed Channel Event schemas, wired into Gateway and Evidence Writer boundaries.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] Every Gateway proposal includes one required private intention draft and rejects Baby-supplied run/turn/sender/hash metadata.
  - [x] Every accepted/rejected event contains the sender-ledger binding, delivery receipt, previous channel hash, entry hash, and channel-writer signature required by §11.5.
  - [x] Interpretation drafts require the delivered channel hash, and all schema failures use the standard Gateway error shape.

#### ALD-036 — Gateway/protocol conformance test suite

- **Spec refs:** `SPECIFICATION.md` [§9. Communication Protocols](SPECIFICATION.md#9-communication-protocols), [§17.2 Test Strategy](SPECIFICATION.md#172-test-strategy)
- **Scope:** Build an extensible automated conformance suite for registered Gateway protocols, rejection behavior, and schema validation, runnable independently of any learner adapter. The fixed-token module is the MVP gate; `ALD-031` and `ALD-033` must add canvas and affect vectors before those modules are declared done.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] The MVP suite exercises fixed-token acceptance/rejection, all six communication controls, dual proposal/delivery hashing, consecutive-rejection pause, and schema failures.
  - [x] The suite runs against a mocked/stub learner, with no dependency on any specific `ALD-044`–047 adapter.
  - [x] A protocol registration test requires every enabled module to contribute accept/reject vectors; the consolidated suite is the gate referenced by EPIC-06 and `ALD-078`.

### EPIC-07 — Observation Hygiene, Scenario Engine, and Deterministic Services

- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] A built Observation validates against the `ALD-002` schema and contains no field not listed in §11.2.
  - [x] Two observations built from identical underlying state are byte-identical after canonicalization (reusing `ALD-006`'s approach).

  - [x] Text-free controls pass while pre-registered adversarial image/text fixtures are quarantined before any adapter receives them.
  - [x] Quarantine events retain artifact hashes and reason codes without exposing raw injection text in Baby-visible or public logs.

- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] Two runs with the same seed and interaction mode produce byte-identical scenarios, private facts, utilities, and task sequences.
  - [x] Every §9.5 interaction profile produces its required utility relationship, including a provably empty zone of possible agreement for `no-agreement-control`.
  - [x] The engine's output feeds `ALD-037`'s Observation builder with no intermediate non-deterministic step.

- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] The interface implements every §6.2 method, including `receive(DeliveredChannelArtifact)` returning a `LedgerDraftEnvelope`.
  - [x] The `no-learning` reference adapter is selectable, performs no policy update, and passes the contract-conformance test.

- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] A contract containing a symbol-meaning example, sample exchange, or prohibited side-channel instruction fails CI and cannot be referenced by a run.
  - [x] Referenced contract versions are immutable and their prompt-bundle hashes appear in run evidence.
  - [x] The no-learning reference and all four adapter tracks are blocked and audited when attempting any state write or output outside the §6.3 tool surface.

#### ALD-046 — Self-supervised ungrounded learner track
- **Priority:** P1 · **Size:** L · **Class:** Later-Research · **Depends on:** ALD-042, ALD-043
- **Spec refs:** `SPECIFICATION.md` [§6.1 Track Definitions](SPECIFICATION.md#61-track-definitions), `EXPERIMENT-NOTEBOOK.md` [E12 — Self-Supervised Ungrounded Baseline](EXPERIMENT-NOTEBOOK.md#e12-self-supervised-ungrounded-baseline)
- **Scope:** Implement the `self-supervised` adapter with the same recurrent backbone as `scratch-rl` where feasible, using a pre-registered predictive or contrastive loss and no scalar reward.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] The track is selectable, starts from recorded random initialization, and rejects any scalar reward supplied to its update path.
  - [x] A full turn and minimal predictive/contrastive update complete end-to-end.
  - [ ] The evidence bundle records the loss definition and proves that outcome labels are not included in the self-supervised update batch.

- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] Every route in §12.5 exists, unprefixed, and drives the correct `ALD-024` state transition.
  - [x] Creating a run via nursery correctly provisions both `baby-a` and `baby-b` instances.
  - [x] Pausing/aborting and derived-run creation use the same state/lineage services as direct internal calls, with no divergent logic path or reopening of terminal parents.

- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [ ] A run created under Mode P and one under Mode R differ exactly along the dimensions listed in §5.3 — no undocumented behavioral difference.
  - [x] The mode is immutable for the lifetime of a run once created (cannot be switched mid-run).
  - [x] The active mode is recorded in the Run Configuration and visible in every exported evidence bundle.

#### ALD-054 — Claim-boundary enforcement

- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] Every claim statement listed in §5.4 is machine-checked against the run's actual recorded mode before being allowed to render/export.
  - [ ] A Mode P run attempting to surface a Mode-R-only claim label is blocked with a specific error, not silently downgraded.
  - [ ] The check is exercised by an automated test for every claim statement in §5.4, not spot-checked manually.

#### ALD-055 — Separate-container isolation for Mode R
- **Priority:** P1 · **Size:** L · **Class:** Research-Grade · **Depends on:** ALD-053
- **Spec refs:** `SPECIFICATION.md` [§5.2 Research-Grade Mode (Mode R)](SPECIFICATION.md#52-research-grade-mode-mode-r)
- **Scope:** Run each learner adapter in Mode R in its own container/process with no shared mutable memory, communicating only through the Gateway and evidence store.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] In Mode R, `baby-a` and `baby-b` learner processes run in distinct OS processes/containers, verified by distinct process IDs / container IDs.
  - [x] No in-memory object reference is shared between the two learner containers (verified by an isolation test attempting cross-container object access and observing failure).

- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [ ] Each trainable learner's update step reads only from its own adapter's local buffers, never from the counterpart process.
  - [ ] An isolation test that attempts to smuggle counterpart-agent internal state into a training update fails to do so, confirmed by the test.
  - [ ] Training isolation is verified specifically under Mode R container separation (`ALD-055`), not just asserted for Mode P.

- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [ ] Every test in §6.5 runs against `scratch-rl`, `self-supervised`, and strict `hybrid`; frozen-LLM and no-learning runs are explicitly classified rather than incorrectly presented as ungrounded.
  - [ ] Linear-probe evaluation uses the pre-registered 95% label-shuffled confidence-interval rule.
  - [ ] Battery results are attached to the run's evidence record so a reviewer can see leakage-test outcomes per run.

- **Spec refs:** `SPECIFICATION.md` [§14.2 Audit Logging](SPECIFICATION.md#142-audit-logging)
- **Scope:** Implement append-only audit records for human views, operator interventions, and safety triggers. Pause/resume/abort/annotate actions must use this path, record actor/reason, and request the mandatory checkpoint; unplanned interventions also create a notebook deviation reference.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] Every §14.2 human view/intervention and §14.5 safety trigger produces an append-only audit record with authenticated actor and machine-readable reason.
  - [ ] Each intervention produces a signed checkpoint, and any unplanned intervention links to an append-only notebook deviation record.

- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] A manual "take snapshot now" action produces a snapshot file set that a restore can consume.
  - [x] Restarting the server after a snapshot automatically restores to that snapshot's state (`autoRestore()`-equivalent behavior).
  - [x] A restored run's evidence-store state matches, byte-for-byte in the chain-walk sense (`ALD-008`), the state at the moment the snapshot was taken.

- **Scope:** Implement the documented failure-handling policy for each named failure mode in §14.5 (evidence-store failure, anchoring failure, learner adapter crash), including registering `process.on('uncaughtException')` and `process.on('unhandledRejection')` handlers so background tasks (checkpoint scheduler, anchoring retries) log rather than crash the server.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] Every failure mode named in §14.5 has an implemented, tested handling path.
  - [x] An unhandled rejection thrown from a background task (e.g., a failed anchor confirmation poll) is caught, logged, and does not crash the server process, confirmed by a fault-injection test.
  - [x] The failure-handling behavior for anchoring failures reuses `ALD-021`'s retry/backoff rather than a separate ad hoc mechanism.

- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] Only eligible non-public, non-mainnet run-bundle payloads are purged; public or mainnet-anchored bundles are retained indefinitely.
  - [x] `run_metadata`, ledger/channel/audit/intervention rows, checkpoint manifests, and anchor receipts remain queryable after purge.
  - [x] The job's actions are themselves audit-logged (`ALD-059`).

- **Scope:** Implement delayed/batched conversion of agent-native ledger state into separately signed, append-only `audit_ledger_entries`, labeled `source: generated-analysis`, with no Baby-readable route or feedback path.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [ ] Every generated interpretation references source native events and is explicitly labeled external analysis.
  - [ ] Baby identities cannot read audit-ledger entries, while authorized researchers and the verifier can.
  - [ ] Audit entries are included in their checkpoint auxiliary tree and exported evidence without modifying native ledger events.

#### ALD-065 — Prohibited UX pattern review checklist
- **Priority:** P1 · **Size:** S · **Class:** MVP · **Depends on:** ALD-063
- **Spec refs:** `SPECIFICATION.md` [§16.2 Diplomacy Table Reuse Boundaries](SPECIFICATION.md#162-diplomacy-table-reuse-boundaries), [§16.3 Prohibited UX Patterns](SPECIFICATION.md#163-prohibited-ux-patterns)
- **Scope:** Audit every reused Diplomacy-style component and run a checklist against all prohibited side-channel, misleading-claim, caucus, coalition, and direct-relay patterns.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [ ] Every reused component is listed with its permitted §16.2 mapping, and no Diplomacy game logic or side-channel route is imported.
  - [ ] Any failing item blocks `ALD-063` from being marked `Done` until resolved.
  - [ ] Every §16.3 prohibition has a pass/fail result, and the checklist reruns after material dashboard changes.

#### ALD-066 — Automated replay fidelity and viewer
- **Priority:** P1 · **Size:** L · **Class:** Research-Grade · **Depends on:** ALD-041, ALD-063
- **Spec refs:** `SPECIFICATION.md` [§14.3 Reproducibility and Replay Fidelity](SPECIFICATION.md#143-reproducibility-and-replay-fidelity)
- **Scope:** Implement scenario replay and deterministic execution `replayDigest` generation/verification per §14.3, then expose the results in a read-only dashboard viewer.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] Same-seed scenario replay reproduces scenario/observation hashes; wrong-seed replay fails automatically.
  - [x] Deterministic adapters reproduce the §14.3 replay digest, while nondeterministic adapters are explicitly `not-applicable` and pass recorded-decision playback only.
  - [ ] The viewer displays machine results and remains read-only; it cannot alter evidence or override a failure.

### EPIC-13 — Security, Red-Team, and Cryptography Track

**Goal:** build red-team harnesses for side-channel and prompt-injection controls, the ephemeral-encoding research harness, and the crypto novelty/security separation policy. **Depends on:** EPIC-06, EPIC-07, EPIC-10. **Acceptance gate:** red-team suites green; separation policy enforced.

#### ALD-067 — Side-channel red-team harness
- **Priority:** P0 · **Size:** M · **Class:** Research-Grade · **Depends on:** ALD-040, ALD-055
- **Spec refs:** `SPECIFICATION.md` [§10.3 Side Channel Controls](SPECIFICATION.md#103-side-channel-controls), `EXPERIMENT-NOTEBOOK.md` [E01 — Channel Isolation and Side-Channel Red-Team](EXPERIMENT-NOTEBOOK.md#e01-channel-isolation-and-side-channel-red-team)
- **Scope:** Build an adversarial test harness that actively attempts to exploit each side channel `ALD-040` claims to have closed, reusing its measurement tooling, sufficient to support `E01`.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [ ] The harness includes at least one active exploit attempt per side-channel category named in §10.3.
  - [ ] Every exploit attempt fails to extract cross-agent information, confirmed by an automated pass/fail check, not manual judgment.
  - [ ] The harness runs under both Mode P and Mode R (`ALD-053`) so `E01`'s isolation comparison is possible.

#### ALD-068 — Observation-text and quarantine-bypass red-team suite
- **Priority:** P0 · **Size:** M · **Class:** Research-Grade · **Depends on:** ALD-039
- **Spec refs:** `SPECIFICATION.md` [§10.2 Prompt Injection Controls](SPECIFICATION.md#102-prompt-injection-controls), `EXPERIMENT-NOTEBOOK.md` [E02 — Observation and Metadata Leakage Audit](EXPERIMENT-NOTEBOOK.md#e02-observation-and-metadata-leakage-audit)
- **Scope:** Build adversarial scenario bundles that hide text in pixels, metadata, filenames, alternate encodings, and malformed assets, attempting to bypass `ALD-039` and reach a Baby observation.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] The suite includes direct text, low-contrast/OCR-evasion fixtures, metadata labels, semantic filenames, and malformed-image cases.
  - [x] Every positive fixture is quarantined and zero raw text reaches an adapter context; negative text-free controls remain loadable.
  - [ ] Results are exported as hashed evidence linked from the E02 Experiment Record, not misrepresented as the Experiment Record itself.

#### ALD-069 — Ephemeral encoding and adversarial cryptography research harness
- **Priority:** P2 · **Size:** L · **Class:** Later-Research · **Depends on:** ALD-031, ALD-057
- **Spec refs:** `SPECIFICATION.md` [§18. Experiment Variable Registry](SPECIFICATION.md#18-experiment-variable-registry), `EXPERIMENT-NOTEBOOK.md` [E40 — Ephemeral Encoding and Adversarial Cryptography](EXPERIMENT-NOTEBOOK.md#e40-ephemeral-encoding-and-adversarial-cryptography)
- **Scope:** Build the research harness needed for `E40` — instrumentation to let two learners develop and test ephemeral, session-specific encodings over the generative carrier channel (`ALD-031`), with a third-party eavesdropper role able to attempt decoding.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [ ] The harness supports at least three roles in a single run: two communicating learners and one eavesdropper observer.
  - [ ] The harness logs every encoding scheme change as a distinct, timestamped event so `E40` can measure encoding lifetime.
  - [ ] The harness itself makes no claim about cryptographic security — it only provides the measurement/instrumentation `E40`'s research execution needs; a passing harness build is not a security claim.

#### ALD-070 — Cryptographic novelty-vs-security separation policy
- **Priority:** P0 · **Size:** S · **Class:** Later-Research · **Depends on:** ALD-009, ALD-019
- **Spec refs:** `SPECIFICATION.md` [§19. Deferred Decisions and ADRs](SPECIFICATION.md#19-deferred-decisions-and-adrs)
- **Scope:** Document and enforce, via a documented review gate, that any learner-invented "encoding" or "cipher" from `ALD-069`'s research (or any other emergent scheme) is never substituted for the production signing/hashing mechanisms in `ALD-009`/`ALD-019` — novelty in a research harness must never be mistaken for or promoted to a security mechanism.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [ ] A written policy statement exists distinguishing "research-harness encoding" from "production cryptographic signing," citing `ALD-009` and `ALD-019` as the only production mechanisms.
  - [ ] A code-level check (e.g., module boundary or lint rule) prevents any `ALD-069`-harness-derived code from being imported into the `ALD-009`/`ALD-019` signing modules.
  - [ ] This policy is included in the documentation set (`ALD-079`) and referenced by `E40`'s readiness gate (`ALD-077`).

### EPIC-14 — Experiment Pre-Registration and E00–E50 Readiness Gates

**Goal:** implement pre-registration binding and the intervention/baseline test scaffold, and define the five readiness gates covering all 19 experiments. **Depends on:** EPIC-05, EPIC-06, EPIC-08, EPIC-13. **Acceptance gate:** Gates G1–G5 all pass. **Note:** items in this epic build software readiness checks; they do not run experiments, interpret results, or draw scientific conclusions — that work stays in `EXPERIMENT-NOTEBOOK.md` as research execution.

- **Scope:** Bind a notebook experiment and sealed hypothesis/parameters to RunConfig, create append-only versioned Experiment Records, and export `experiment-record.json` with disposition/checkpoint/anchor/verifier/deviation references.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [ ] A confirmatory run cannot start without a bound experiment ID, protocol commit, external registration URL, canonical pre-registration hash, and matching pre-run anchor receipt.
  - [x] Pre-registration creates Experiment Record version `1`; later disposition/evidence changes append higher versions without updating prior rows.
  - [x] Every evidence bundle contains the latest record plus its version history and references resolvable by an independent reviewer.

#### ALD-072 — Intervention test suite and baseline/statistics scaffold
- **Priority:** P1 · **Size:** L · **Class:** MVP · **Depends on:** ALD-041, ALD-071
- **Spec refs:** `SPECIFICATION.md` [§15.2 Intervention Test Suite](SPECIFICATION.md#152-intervention-test-suite), [§15.3 Evaluation Baselines and Statistics](SPECIFICATION.md#153-evaluation-baselines-and-statistics)
- **Scope:** Build the software scaffold (not the scientific analysis itself) that lets a pre-registered intervention be applied to a deterministic scenario run (`ALD-041`) and that computes the baseline statistics named in §15.3 over run output.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] An intervention defined in a pre-registration reference (`ALD-071`) can be toggled on/off for a run via configuration, with no code change per intervention.
  - [x] The scaffold computes every baseline statistic named in §15.3 over a completed run's evidence.
  - [x] The scaffold's output is a data structure ready for a researcher's downstream analysis — it does not itself draw or store scientific conclusions.

- **Scope:** Define and check the readiness gate confirming the software capability required for `E00`–`E03` exists and passes its own conformance checks — the gate asserts *capability is ready to run the experiment*, not that the experiment has been run or what it found.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [x] `E00` readiness: the verifier accepts an unchanged anchored bundle and rejects all 14 mutation/anchor cases in LEDGER §17, including wrong-chain anchors and unanchored tails.
  - [ ] `E01`/`E02` readiness: `ALD-067`/`ALD-068` red-team suites are green.
  - [x] `E03` readiness: `ALD-029`/`ALD-036` run all six controls with dual-hash evidence, while `ALD-041`/`ALD-042`/`ALD-072` provide deterministic scenarios, no-learning behavior, confidence intervals, and effect sizes.

- **Scope:** Define and check the readiness gate confirming every model track and protocol capability that `E10`–`E16` require exists and passes conformance, across all seven experiments in this range.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [ ] `E10`/`E11`/`E12` readiness: `ALD-044`/`ALD-045`/`ALD-046` complete full turns; ungrounded tracks pass training isolation and semantic-leakage qualification.
  - [ ] `E13` readiness: all `ALD-031` alternate carriers pass conformance and `ALD-032` leakage evaluation can compare all five notebook carrier conditions.
  - [ ] `E14`/`E15`/`E16` readiness: `ALD-072` supports role reversal, held-out splits, and causal interventions, and `ALD-064` produces separately labeled human audit interpretations.

#### ALD-075 — Gate G3: Affect and learning-comparison readiness (E20–E22)
- **Priority:** P1 · **Size:** S · **Class:** MVP · **Depends on:** ALD-023, ALD-033, ALD-042, ALD-044, ALD-045, ALD-046, ALD-072

- **Scope:** Define and check the readiness gate confirming the six-display affect channel and the RL/non-RL comparison capability required for `E20`–`E22` exist and pass conformance.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [ ] `E20` readiness: `ALD-033` affect protocol independently passes conformance with all six displays exercised.
  - [ ] `E21` readiness: no-learning (`ALD-042`), frozen-LLM (`ALD-044`), extrinsic/intrinsic scratch-RL (`ALD-045`), and self-supervised (`ALD-046`) modes run under the same scenario configuration.
  - [x] `E22` readiness: `ALD-072`'s scaffold supports a staged/curriculum sequence of interventions within a single run.

#### ALD-076 — Gate G4: Transfer and negotiation-scenario readiness (E30–E32)
- **Priority:** P2 · **Size:** S · **Class:** Later-Research · **Depends on:** ALD-028, ALD-041, ALD-072

- **Scope:** Define and check the readiness gate confirming derived-run support, deterministic long-run analysis, and the Scenario Engine's aligned/private/semi-cooperative/conflicting utility configurations are sufficient for partner-replacement, longitudinal, and negotiation experiments.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [ ] `E30` readiness: `ALD-028` derived-run support can substitute a new learner adapter in the child run without altering the parent.
  - [ ] `E31` readiness: `ALD-072`'s baseline/statistics scaffold can compare metrics across a long sequence of turns/checkpoints for drift analysis.
  - [ ] `E32` readiness: `ALD-041` produces each pre-registered cooperative and negotiation utility condition from configuration without a code change.

#### ALD-077 — Gate G5: Cryptography-research and replication readiness (E40, E50)
- **Priority:** P2 · **Size:** S · **Class:** Later-Research · **Depends on:** ALD-069, ALD-070, ALD-028, ALD-072

- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [ ] `E40` readiness: `ALD-069` harness and `ALD-070` separation policy both pass their own acceptance criteria.
  - [ ] `E50` readiness: `ALD-028` derived-run support and `ALD-072`'s scaffold together launch the same pre-registered configuration across independent seeds and aggregate baseline statistics.
  - [ ] This gate's checklist cross-references the `EXPERIMENT-NOTEBOOK.md` [§12. Publication Checklist](EXPERIMENT-NOTEBOOK.md#12-publication-checklist) items that are software-verifiable, without asserting any of the checklist's research-judgment items are satisfied.

### EPIC-15 — CI/Test Suites, Documentation, Operations, and Release

**Goal:** consolidate all test suites into CI, produce the documentation set, and define the release/publication mapping. **Depends on:** all prior epics. **Acceptance gate:** CI green on consolidated suite; docs and release mapping complete.

#### ALD-078 — CI pipeline and consolidated test suite
- **Priority:** P0 · **Size:** L · **Class:** MVP · **Depends on:** ALD-011, ALD-036, ALD-057, ALD-067, ALD-068
- **Spec refs:** `SPECIFICATION.md` [§17.2 Test Strategy](SPECIFICATION.md#172-test-strategy)
- **Scope:** Stand up a CI pipeline running, on every change: the crash-safety suite (`ALD-011`), the Gateway conformance suite (`ALD-036`), the semantic-leakage battery (`ALD-057`), and both red-team suites (`ALD-067`/`068`), plus every other item's own acceptance tests referenced elsewhere in this backlog.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [ ] CI runs on every proposed change and blocks merge on any failing suite.
  - [ ] The consolidated suite includes at least one test per `Done` item's acceptance criteria at the time CI is stood up.
  - [ ] CI run time and flakiness are tracked; a flaky test is quarantined with a tracked follow-up, not silently ignored.

#### ALD-079 — Architecture/API/operations documentation set
- **Priority:** P1 · **Size:** M · **Class:** MVP · **Depends on:** ALD-048, ALD-049, ALD-050, ALD-055, ALD-060

- **Scope:** Write the documentation set covering: architecture overview, full API reference (all routes from EPIC-09), Mode R operational runbook (container isolation, `ALD-055`), and the snapshot/restore/recovery runbook (`ALD-060`).
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [ ] Every route implemented in EPIC-09 has a corresponding API reference entry with request/response shape.
  - [ ] The Mode R runbook lets an operator who has not read the source code stand up an isolated run following the documented steps alone.
  - [ ] The snapshot/restore runbook is validated by having someone other than the implementer follow it to perform a real restore.

#### ALD-080 — Release process and publication-checklist mapping
- **Priority:** P1 · **Size:** S · **Class:** MVP · **Depends on:** ALD-071, ALD-077, ALD-079
- **Spec refs:** `EXPERIMENT-NOTEBOOK.md` [§12. Publication Checklist](EXPERIMENT-NOTEBOOK.md#12-publication-checklist)
- **Scope:** Define the release process for the software (versioning, tagging, changelog) and produce a mapping from each `EXPERIMENT-NOTEBOOK.md` §12 publication-checklist item to the specific backlog item(s)/gate(s) that make it achievable, without claiming any research-judgment checklist item as satisfied by software alone.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [ ] A documented release process exists (version scheme, changelog convention, tagging) consistent with §1's normative-language conventions.
  - [ ] Every software-verifiable item in the §12 publication checklist is mapped to at least one `ALD-XXX` ID or Gate (`ALD-073`–`077`).
  - [ ] The mapping explicitly flags which §12 checklist items are research-judgment calls outside this backlog's scope (e.g., "results support the stated hypothesis"), rather than silently omitting them.

## 13. Experiment Readiness Gate Mapping

This table maps every experiment in `EXPERIMENT-NOTEBOOK.md` §7–§8 to the readiness gate (and underlying backlog items) that must be `Done` before the experiment can be executed. **A passing gate means the software capability exists and conforms to spec — it is not a claim about the experiment's scientific outcome.** Running the experiment, analyzing data, and drawing conclusions remain research-execution activities in `EXPERIMENT-NOTEBOOK.md`, outside this backlog's scope.

**Gate ordering:** G1 → G2 → G3 → G4 → G5 is required only where a later gate's underlying items depend on an earlier gate's items (e.g., G2's `ALD-036` depends transitively on G1's `ALD-015`-adjacent lifecycle work). Gates do not need to be executed in strict experiment-numeric order beyond what their item dependencies already require.

## 15. Decisions and Assumptions

These are working decisions this backlog encodes. Where a decision is not yet made in the source documents, it is marked accordingly rather than invented.

- **Runtime/language:** Node.js + TypeScript, npm workspaces monorepo (ALD-001). No calendar dates or staffing levels are assumed anywhere in this backlog; all sequencing is dependency-based.
- **Evidence store:** SQLite in WAL mode is the sole authoritative local store (ALD-005), per `LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md` [§18. Recommended Initial Decision](LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md#18-recommended-initial-decision). No external database is introduced by this backlog.
- **Anchoring:** Base Sepolia is the default and only unconditional anchoring target (ALD-020); mainnet anchoring exists only as an explicit, separately-configured opt-in (ALD-022), never a default.
- **Model default:** `scratch-rl` (ALD-045) is the primary scientific baseline; the local open-weight `frozen-llm` adapter (ALD-044) is the orchestration-validation default. `no-learning` (ALD-042), `self-supervised` (ALD-046), and `hybrid` (ALD-047) are explicit selections.
- **Isolation:** Mode R uses separate containers/processes per learner with no shared mutable state (ALD-055); Mode P has no such isolation guarantee and must never be labeled with a Mode-R-only claim (ALD-054).
- **On-chain privacy:** only checkpoint root hashes and minimal metadata are ever placed on-chain (ALD-018, ALD-020); no raw observation, model, or private data is anchored, per `SPECIFICATION.md` [§13.6](SPECIFICATION.md#136-privacy-controls) and `LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md` [§12](LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md#12-privacy).
- **Research vs. software boundary:** this backlog treats every `E00`–`E50` experiment as something the software must make *executable*, never as a task this backlog itself completes. EPIC-14's gates check capability readiness only (§13 of this document is explicit about this).
- **Cryptography research boundary:** `ALD-069`'s ephemeral-encoding harness is explicitly research instrumentation; `ALD-070` enforces that its output is never substituted for the production integrity mechanisms in EPIC-02/EPIC-04.
- **Sizing/priority are relative, not calendar-based:** S/M/L reflect complexity, not effort-days; P0/P1/P2 reflect blast radius on integrity/critical-path/research-readiness, not business value.
- **Open/undecided (not invented here):** the specific open-weight frozen-LLM model, exact retention durations for §14.6, and exact confirmation-depth thresholds for §13.4 are left to be filled in when their owning item (ALD-044, ALD-062, ALD-021 respectively) is picked up, using whatever value the source documents specify at that time — this backlog does not invent them.

### Implementation decisions recorded during the verifiable-core build (2026-09-07)

These resolve details the source documents name but do not fix. Each is implemented, tested, and referenced from code comments.

- **Hash domains.** LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md and SPECIFICATION.md name six domain separators; the implementation defines the remaining ones in `packages/types/src/domains.ts` (`HASH_DOMAINS`): channel event, affect event and measurement, audit-ledger entry, intervention event and causal probe, turn record, Baby proposal, rejected payload, run config/id/manifest, pre-registration, scenario bundle/state, observation, action, outcome, prompt bundle, policy checkpoint, carrier-form inventory, glyph bundle, retention log, failure message, runtime snapshot, encoding scheme, nonce commitment, and PRNG seed. All follow `SHA-256(domain || 0x00 || payload)`; only Merkle interior nodes use `0x01`.
- **Turn-record stream.** SPEC §14.3 needs per-turn hashes for the replay digest, so the Evidence Store carries an implementation-defined `turns` stream (`turn_records`, migration v2), witness-signed and committed as the auxiliary checkpoint tree `turns`. `intervention_log` stays hash-chained but unsigned and is exported without a checkpoint tree (LEDGER §8 auxiliary trees require a writer key).
- **Checkpoint manifest `reason`.** LEDGER §8's manifest is illustrative; the implementation adds a `reason` enum recording the LEDGER §9 trigger so intervention checkpoints are verifiable.
- **Empty trees.** A stream with no events is committed as `treeSize 0`, `EMPTY_MERKLE_ROOT`, `lastEntryHash = GENESIS_HASH`; a size-0 auxiliary tree is omitted from `auxiliaryTrees` and a verifier reads the omission as the empty tree (docs/evidence-bundle-format.md §6). A single-leaf Merkle root is the leaf hash (leaves are already domain-hashed).
- **Ledger draft `evidenceRefs`.** Non-empty `evidenceRefs` on a draft are merged into `content.evidenceRefs` of the committed event (LEDGER §4 example shape).
- **Communication controls.** `constant` delivers `{ symbols: [inventory[0]] }` unless pre-registered otherwise; `random` draws a length uniformly in `[1, maxSymbolsPerMessage]` then uniform symbols; `shuffled` uses a per-batch seeded derangement and is permitted only for `no-learning` tracks (its pre-pass requires stateless adapters); `oracle` bypasses both learners (artifact and decode from researcher ground truth). Timeouts and other payload-less rejections hash canonical `null`.
- **Anchor receipts.** `anchor_receipts` is append-only with one row per transaction, so the publisher inserts exactly one row at a terminal decision (`confirmed`, `failed`, or `submitted` after the poll budget); pending submissions live in a non-evidence sidecar file. `safe-tag` finality is an interim 32-confirmation proxy (ADR-05). Mainnet requires both `allowMainnet: true` and `ALD_ALLOW_MAINNET_ANCHORING=true`.
- **Experiment records.** Version 1 is written at run creation with `disposition: invalid` (SPEC §7.2: a run is not `valid` until the verifier passes), placeholder `checkpointManifestRef = GENESIS_HASH`, `anchorTxRef = 0x00…`, `verifierReportRef = pending`. Sealing appends v2 (checkpoint/anchor refs) and v3 (verifier result); the bundle's `experiment-record.json` is rewritten after v3.
- **Unanchorable prototype runs.** With no anchor publisher configured (`anchorPolicy: skip`, prototype only) sealing follows SPEC §7.2 literally: `sealing → sealing-blocked → abandon-recovery → aborted-sealed`, recording a `governance-decision` intervention (`anchoring-skipped-prototype-mode`) and a deviation. Such runs are never `valid`.
- **Verifier local-integrity mode.** `--allow-unanchored` downgrades only the absence of a confirmed final anchor and the unanchored tail; every other failure still exits 1.
- **Adapter failures.** SPEC §14.5: one retry, then forfeit the turn (null action, turn record written), append a `safety-trigger` intervention, and pause. `evaluating` has no `pause` row in §7.2, so a trigger there records `pause-not-available` and continues (spec gap flagged).
- **Run configuration.** Optional `evaluationTurns` (runtime default 200) fixes the evaluation-phase budget; `symbolInventorySize`/`maxSymbolsPerMessage` are valid only for `fixed-token` and `maxStrokes` only for `generative-canvas`.
- **Learner contracts.** Files carry a `<!-- contract: <track> version: <n> -->` header exempt from the banned-pattern lint; `promptBundleHash` is the canonical hash of `{ track: text }`.
- **Key store.** Per-run seeds under `<ALD_KEY_DIR>/<runId>/signers.json` (0600/0700); runId grammar `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]{0,127}$`.
- **Twin routes (Mode P).** Roles arrive as `x-ald-role` + `x-ald-service-token`; default dev tokens `dev-<role>` exist only for prototype mode. `POST /reset` returns 501 until the runtime exposes adapter re-initialization. `GET /runs` is added as a read-only convenience implied by the session routes.
