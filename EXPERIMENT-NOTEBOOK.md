## 1. Purpose

This notebook turns the Nursery Lab concept into an ordered research program. It is
designed to be checked off as experiments are prepared, executed, verified, reviewed,
and replicated.

Do not replace planned hypotheses with post-hoc explanations. Record failed runs,
protocol deviations, null results, channel violations, and integrity failures.

The notebook is a human research record. Anchored run evidence, not a checked box, is
the authoritative proof of what occurred.

## 2. Status Legend

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Not started | Protocol exists but no pre-registration is sealed |
| Pre-registered | Hypothesis, parameters, seeds, and analysis plan are committed |
| Running | At least one planned run is active |
| Evidence review | Runs ended; integrity and protocol checks are in progress |
| Complete | Planned runs and analysis are complete |
| Replicated | Independent repetition met the pre-registered replication rule |
| Blocked | A documented dependency or integrity problem prevents execution |
| Invalid | Evidence or protocol failure prevents scientific interpretation |

## 3. Notebook Integrity Rules

For every experiment:

- commit the pre-registered protocol before starting;
- record the Git commit in the experiment record;
- for confirmatory/public runs, register the protocol externally and anchor the same
  pre-registration hash before the run starts;
- include the protocol commit in the run configuration hash;
- verify both Baby ledgers and the transcript before analyzing behavior;
- record the final checkpoint hash and Base anchor transaction;
- commit result notes without rewriting the pre-registration;
- append corrections with dates and reasons;
- never delete an invalid or negative run from the run index.

If the notebook changes after pre-registration, record the change as a protocol
amendment and apply it only to new runs unless the original analysis plan explicitly
permits otherwise.

## 4. Study Metadata

## 5. Default Experimental Invariants

Unless an experiment explicitly varies one of these, hold it constant:

- Baby A and Baby B run in separate processes or containers;
- no direct network route exists between the Babies;
- the deterministic Symbol Gateway is the only communication route;
- the BabySitter receives complete read-only audit access but sends no semantic
  guidance or reward;
- private observations contain no human-language labels or text;
- public output uses only the pre-registered carrier;
- ledgers and transcript use the integrity design in
  [LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md](LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md);
- the affect channel is disabled unless explicitly under study;
- experiment schedules and seeds are fixed before the run;
- software-qualification, blinded-pilot, confirmatory, and replication seeds use
  disjoint SHA-256 domains; paired conditions share only their scenario seed;
- pilot outcomes select only the predeclared seed-count prefix and never enter a
  confirmatory or replication estimate;
- held-out evaluation runs with learning disabled;
- no production secrets or personal data appear in any experiment.

The exact derivation, tuning limit, candidate N grid, ordered reserves, per-condition
allocations, and current zero-spend local resource ceiling are frozen in
[`protocols/seed-and-resource-allocation.v1.json`](protocols/seed-and-resource-allocation.v1.json).
The generated ledger contains design commitments only; it is not evidence that any
pilot or study seed has run.

## E00. Ledger Integrity and Simulated Commitment

**Status:** Registered qualification attempt v2 failed closed; v3 amendment pending

**Purpose:** Qualify the evidence system before collecting behavioral data.

**Hypothesis:** The verifier accepts an unchanged run bundle and rejects every
pre-registered mutation of a committed ledger or transcript.

### Preparation

- [ ] Implement local hash chains and Ed25519 signatures.
- [ ] Implement ordered Merkle checkpoints.
- [ ] Implement standalone verifier.
- [ ] Bind `anchorClass: "simulated"` and configure the deterministic transport.
- [ ] Pre-register checkpoint frequency and finality rule.
- [ ] Seal protocol commit and configuration hashes.

### Procedure

- [ ] Create a synthetic run with at least 100 events in each Baby ledger.
- [ ] Produce at least three checkpoints.
- [ ] Commit each checkpoint through the deterministic simulation transport.
- [ ] Verify the unchanged bundle through both independent verifier implementations.
- [ ] Relabel a simulated receipt as public-chain evidence and verify rejection.
- [ ] Modify one event payload and verify rejection.
- [ ] Delete a middle event and verify rejection.
- [ ] Insert an event and verify rejection.
- [ ] Reorder two events and verify rejection.
- [ ] Replace a signature and verify rejection.
- [ ] Modify a Merkle proof and verify rejection.
- [ ] Present a checkpoint from the wrong chain and verify rejection.
- [ ] Add an unanchored tail and verify that it is reported.
- [ ] Restore from checkpoint and append new events without reusing a sequence number.

### Acceptance Criteria

- unchanged evidence passes;
- every mutation case fails verification;
- the final checkpoint hash matches Base calldata or the anchor event;
- restart produces a consistent extension proof;
- no private ledger content appears on-chain.

### Results

| Metric | Planned | Observed |
|---|---:|---:|
| Valid bundle accepted | 100% | 1/1 attempted unchanged bundle accepted by both verifiers before fail-closed stop |
| Mutation cases detected | 100% | 5/6 attempted cases rejected by both; modified inclusion proof rejected by TypeScript but accepted by Rust |
| Anchor receipts verified | 100% | `TBD` |
| Private content found on-chain | 0 | `TBD` |

- [ ] Integrity acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Evidence review complete
- [ ] Base anchor verified
- [ ] Result committed

**Result summary:** v2 slot 1 stopped at the first dual-verifier disagreement. Slots
2-5 were not attempted and slot 1 will not be rerun into success. The Rust auditor
did not inspect inclusion-proof files; the failed receipt is retained at
`reports/research/e00-integrity-qualification-attempt-1.json`. V3 binds the repaired
auditor and a fresh seed domain before any further attempt.

## E01. Channel Isolation and Side-Channel Red Team

**Status:** Not started

**Depends on:** E00

**Purpose:** Demonstrate that the Symbol Gateway is the only practical communication
route.

**Hypothesis:** Deliberate attempts to communicate through prohibited outputs, tools,
timing, retries, identifiers, errors, storage, or network routes are blocked and
recorded.

### Procedure

- [ ] Attempt English and other human-language text.
- [ ] Attempt arbitrary Unicode and non-allowlisted emoji.
- [ ] Attempt URLs, code, JSON extensions, and tool-like text.
- [ ] Attempt message-length and whitespace signaling.
- [ ] Attempt timing and retry-count signaling.
- [ ] Attempt model-generated identifiers.
- [ ] Attempt filesystem, clipboard, environment, and process access.
- [ ] Attempt direct network access between Baby containers.
- [ ] Attempt shared cache, vector store, replay buffer, and snapshot access.
- [ ] Attempt malformed payloads designed to trigger distinguishable errors.
- [ ] Verify normalized rejection timing and envelope.
- [ ] Verify every attempt appears in the audit log.

### Acceptance Criteria

- zero prohibited payloads reach the other Baby;
- zero direct side routes are available;
- rejection outputs do not reveal the attempted content;
- all attempts are represented in anchored evidence.

### Results

| Test category | Attempts | Blocked | Evidence verified |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Human language | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` |
| Unicode / emoji | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` |
| Timing / retries | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` |
| Tools / storage / network | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` |
| Error behavior | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` |

- [ ] Isolation criteria met
- [ ] Residual risks documented
- [ ] Result committed

**Result summary:** `Not run`

## E02. Observation and Metadata Leakage Audit

**Status:** Not started

**Depends on:** E00

**Purpose:** Prove that observations do not silently supply human labels or target
answers.

**Hypothesis:** A classifier using only prohibited metadata cannot predict target
identity above the pre-registered chance interval.

### Procedure

- [ ] Inventory every observation field and representation.
- [ ] Scan images for text and OCR output.
- [ ] Remove filenames, captions, labels, semantic IDs, and human-readable errors.
- [ ] Randomize object ordering independently of target identity.
- [ ] Verify timestamps and identifiers do not encode scenario state.
- [ ] Train a leakage probe on metadata without pixels or approved sensor features.
- [ ] Run the probe on held-out scenarios.
- [ ] Repeat after snapshot and restore.
- [ ] Review sensory encoders for language-aligned pretraining.

### Acceptance Criteria

- metadata-only prediction meets a pre-registered equivalence or upper-bound test
  ruling out the smallest leakage effect of interest; non-significance is insufficient;
- no OCR-visible human language exists in baseline observations;
- initially ungrounded runs use no text-aligned encoder;
- all exceptions are documented as separate experimental conditions.

### Results

| Probe | Chance | Observed | 95% CI | Decision |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| Metadata-only target prediction | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` |
| Identifier-only prediction | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` |
| Timing-only prediction | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` |

- [ ] Observation hygiene criteria met
- [ ] Encoder provenance recorded
- [ ] Result committed

**Result summary:** `Not run`

## E03. Chance, No-Communication, and Random-Message Controls

**Status:** Not started

**Depends on:** E01, E02

**Purpose:** Establish whether the task can be solved without meaningful
communication.

**Hypothesis:** Performance remains at chance when communication is disabled,
messages are randomized, or receiver access to messages is shuffled.

A numerically complete worked registration for this experiment is provided in
[RESEARCH.md Appendix D](RESEARCH.md#appendix-d-worked-preregistration-example-e03-controls).
Its D05 amendment uses seed-level primary tests, treats high-rate seeds as mandatory
leakage-review triggers rather than an uncalibrated count rejection, and is backed by
the independent bounded simulation in
[`docs/statistical-validation-and-power.md`](docs/statistical-validation-and-power.md).

### Conditions

1. channel disabled;
2. fixed constant message;
3. random valid message;
4. messages shuffled across episodes;
5. normal channel with no learning;
6. oracle communication for an upper bound.

### Procedure

- [ ] Pre-register task chance rate and evaluation episode count.
- [ ] Run every condition with the same scenario seeds.
- [ ] Preserve identical observation and action interfaces.
- [ ] Calculate confidence intervals and effect sizes.
- [ ] Verify all evidence bundles before analysis.

### Acceptance Criteria

- disabled, constant, random, shuffled, and normal no-learning conditions meet the
  pre-registered equivalence test around chance;
- oracle condition materially exceeds chance;
- any above-chance control triggers a leakage investigation before E10 or E11.

### Results

| Condition | Planned seeds | Invalid seeds | Valid seeds | Episodes per seed | Mean seed success | Equivalence / bound decision |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Disabled | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` |
| Constant | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` |
| Random | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` |
| Shuffled | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` |
| No learning | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` |
| Oracle | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` |

- [ ] Control criteria met
- [ ] Leakage investigation closed
- [ ] Result committed

**Result summary:** `Not run`

## E10. Frozen Pretrained-LLM Protocol Baseline

**Status:** Not started

**Depends on:** E03

**Purpose:** Validate orchestration and study external protocol invention by
language-capable agents.

**Hypothesis:** Frozen LLMs with private memory can establish a useful external
protocol while complying with the no-human-language channel.

### Procedure

- [ ] Select and record a small open-weight instruction model.
- [ ] Freeze model parameters.
- [ ] Apply the learner contract without semantic examples.
- [ ] Use a fixed random symbol inventory.
- [ ] Disable affect.
- [ ] Run naming tasks with role reversal.
- [ ] Evaluate on held-out object combinations with learning disabled.
- [ ] Run human-language and side-channel audit.
- [ ] Compare private ledgers with causal symbol interventions.

- [ ] Claim boundary included in report
- [ ] Result committed

**Result summary:** `Not run`

## E11. From-Scratch RL Naming Game

**Status:** Not started

**Depends on:** E03

**Purpose:** Establish an initially ungrounded multi-agent reinforcement-learning
baseline.

**Hypothesis:** Independently initialized recurrent agents can learn a grounded
one-symbol referential protocol from task outcomes.

### Procedure

- [ ] Initialize independent recurrent policies from recorded seeds.
- [ ] Use non-text-aligned observations.
- [ ] Use independent optimizers and replay or trajectory storage.
- [ ] Provide no shared gradients or centralized hidden state.
- [ ] Begin with one symbol and four candidate objects per episode.
- [ ] Train across pre-registered episodes and seeds.
- [ ] Reverse sender and receiver roles.
- [ ] Evaluate with learning disabled.
- [ ] Compare against E03 controls.

### Results

## E12. Self-Supervised Ungrounded Baseline

**Status:** Not started

**Depends on:** E11 infrastructure

**Purpose:** Test whether communication emerges without a scalar task reward.

**Hypothesis:** Predictive or contrastive learning can create reusable partner-specific
signals, but may produce weaker task-directed coordination than RL.

### Procedure

- [ ] Use the same observations, carrier, and model capacity as E11 where possible.
- [ ] Remove scalar task reward from policy updates.
- [ ] Pre-register predictive or contrastive loss.
- [ ] Prevent outcome labels from leaking through the loss.
- [ ] Train across the same scenario and seed bundles.
- [ ] Evaluate task success, mutual prediction, and causal listening.
- [ ] Compare with E11 and E03.

### Results

| Metric | E11 RL | E12 self-supervised | Difference |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Task success | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` |
| Partner prediction | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` |
| Causal listening | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` |
| Stable symbol reuse | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` |

- [ ] No scalar reward verified
- [ ] Comparative analysis complete
- [ ] Result committed

**Result summary:** `Not run`

## E13. No Predefined Symbol Library

**Status:** Not started

**Depends on:** E11 or E12

**Purpose:** Test whether agents invent both signal forms and meanings.

**Hypothesis:** A bounded blank carrier supports repeatable graphical or gestural
conventions without a predefined symbol inventory.

### Conditions

1. fixed random token inventory;
2. unfamiliar fixed glyph inventory;
3. blank bounded bitmap;
4. constrained vector strokes;
5. short unlabeled tone patterns.

### Procedure

- [ ] Pre-register carrier capacity and artifact normalization.
- [ ] Prevent hidden text, metadata, filenames, and variable envelope sizes.
- [ ] Content-address every generated artifact.
- [ ] Record first creation, imitation, modification, and reuse.
- [ ] Run the same scenarios across carrier conditions.
- [ ] Evaluate form stability, meaning stability, bandwidth, and generalization.

### Results

- [ ] Result committed

**Result summary:** `Not run`

## E14. Turn-Taking, Role Reversal, and Repair

**Status:** Not started

**Depends on:** E13

**Purpose:** Test whether the protocol supports dialogue rather than one-way labeling.

**Hypothesis:** Alternating speaker and listener roles creates reusable confirmation,
uncertainty, repetition, and repair behavior.

### Procedure

- [ ] Pre-register ambiguous and unambiguous scenarios.
- [ ] Alternate roles on a fixed schedule.
- [ ] Introduce controlled misunderstandings.
- [ ] Permit a bounded second turn without adding new channel capacity.
- [ ] Measure whether the receiver requests or elicits repair.
- [ ] Test whether repair forms generalize to new referents.

### Results

| Metric | Result |
|---|---|
| Successful repair rate | `TBD` |
| Turns per resolved ambiguity | `TBD` |
| Role symmetry | `TBD` |
| Reused repair constructions | `TBD` |
| Held-out repair success | `TBD` |

- [ ] Repair behavior causally verified
- [ ] Role asymmetries documented
- [ ] Result committed

**Result summary:** `Not run`

## E15. Composition and Held-Out Generalization

**Status:** Not started

**Depends on:** E14

**Purpose:** Determine whether agents combine reusable parts rather than memorize whole
scenes.

**Hypothesis:** Restricted bandwidth and systematic held-out combinations encourage
compositional reuse.

### Procedure

- [ ] Define primitive attributes and combinations in researcher ground truth only.
- [ ] Hold out pre-registered combinations from training.
- [ ] Run the confirmatory 32-symbol/4-token and 128-symbol/8-token conditions with
      equal model capacity, training episodes, update count, and compute budget.
- [ ] Use at least 75 independent seeds per condition and increase that count before
      registration if simulation shows less than 90% power for a 0.10 absolute
      held-out-success difference.
- [ ] Treat any additional bandwidth or model-capacity levels as exploratory.
- [ ] Freeze learning for evaluation.
- [ ] Compare task success, topographic measures, and behavioral composition.
- [ ] Reorder, delete, and substitute candidate message parts.
- [ ] Avoid declaring compositionality from one metric.

### Results

| Condition | Planned seeds | Invalid seeds | Valid seeds | Seen success | Held-out success | Symbol reuse | Order sensitivity |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 32 symbols / 4 tokens | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` |
| 128 symbols / 8 tokens | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` |

- [ ] Held-out split integrity verified
- [ ] Multiple compositionality measures reported
- [ ] Result committed

**Result summary:** `Not run`

## E16. Causal Listening and Ledger Validity

**Status:** Not started

**Depends on:** E15

**Purpose:** Verify that messages causally affect receiver behavior and that ledger
hypotheses predict those effects.

**Hypothesis:** Substituting, masking, or reordering a form changes receiver behavior
in the direction predicted by the corresponding ledger, and pre-outcome ledger
predictions add held-out predictive value beyond non-ledger comparators.

### Procedure

- [ ] Select ledger hypotheses before viewing intervention outcomes.
- [ ] Replace a message with a constant control.
- [ ] Substitute each candidate form.
- [ ] Mask individual message positions.
- [ ] Reorder multi-part messages.
- [ ] Replay identical observations with counterfactual messages.
- [ ] Compare native ledger predictions with human audit interpretations.
- [ ] Fit transcript-only, task-history, policy-state, random, and majority prediction
      baselines without access to private ledger content.
- [ ] Select the strongest eligible baseline using validation data only, then compare
      its preregistered proper prediction score with the frozen ledger predictor on
      untouched intervention cases.
- [ ] Record positive signaling and positive listening separately.
- [ ] For the primary H2 contrast, compare ledger-consistent substitutions with
      shuffled-control messages in scratch-RL/extrinsic/fixed-token runs using a
      hierarchical model with run/seed random intercepts.
- [ ] Use at least 75 independent seeds and a fixed per-seed intervention budget
      selected before outcomes are inspected.

### Acceptance Criteria

- normal messages outperform constant and shuffled controls;
- receiver actions change under message intervention;
- pre-outcome ledger predictions improve the registered proper score beyond the
  validation-selected non-ledger baseline by the registered practical threshold;
- external audit interpretations are labeled separately from agent-native state.

## E20. Constrained Affect-Channel Study

**Status:** Not started

**Depends on:** E16

**Purpose:** Test whether affect feedback improves learning without becoming a second
language.

**Hypothesis:** A fixed, low-frequency affect channel may improve repair or convergence,
but can leak referent information unless strictly constrained.

### Conditions

1. no affect;
2. six-display declared affect;
3. six-display permuted mapping;
4. six opaque affect tokens;
5. derived affect from measured internal state.

### Procedure

- [ ] Enforce the exact six-display allowlist.
- [ ] Permit one display only in fixed post-outcome windows.
- [ ] Normalize timing and envelope size.
- [ ] Prevent repetitions, combinations, and extra windows.
- [ ] Match scenarios and seeds across conditions.
- [ ] Measure convergence, repair, and task success.
- [ ] Collect at least 75 independent seeds with at least 1,000 eligible affect
      windows **per seed** in each enabled affect condition, unless a registered
      simulation requires more.
- [ ] Estimate conditional mutual information between affect and four-way referent
      after stratifying by binary success/failure outcome, using a Miller-Madow
      bias-corrected discrete estimator and within-outcome permutation null.
- [ ] For each seed, subtract the mean of 1,000 within-outcome permutations from the
      observed Miller-Madow estimate; test whether the seed-level Student-t one-sided
      95% upper bound on this excess CMI is below 0.02 bits. Report the percentile
      seed-bootstrap upper bound as sensitivity analysis only.
- [ ] Before registration, simulate the complete estimator at the registered
      windows-per-seed count and require at least 90% probability that the null-case

## E22. Developmental Plasticity and Curriculum

**Status:** Not started

**Depends on:** E16

**Purpose:** Model rapid early development through measurable mechanisms rather than
age role-play.

**Hypothesis:** Early high plasticity followed by stabilization changes acquisition
speed, convention stability, and generalization.

### Conditions

- constant learning rate and exploration;
- high early learning rate with annealing;
- high early exploration with annealing;
- growing episodic memory;
- staged sensory or motor complexity;
- staged carrier bandwidth;
- consolidation intervals;
- precommitted curriculum versus neutral closed-door schedule.

## E30. Partner Replacement and Zero-Shot Transfer

**Status:** Not started

**Depends on:** E20-E22

**Purpose:** Distinguish a partner-specific code from a teachable or generalizable
language.

**Hypothesis:** Highly co-adapted pairs lose performance with a new partner, while
structured protocols transfer more successfully.

### Training Conditions

1. fixed dyad for the complete training budget;
2. partner-varied training with eight independently initialized partners presented
   round-robin under the same total interaction and update budget.

For each seed, **replacement degradation** is the held-in-partner success rate minus
the new-partner success rate. The fixed-dyad held-in value uses its original partner.
The partner-varied held-in value is the equal-weight mean across its eight training
partners. H7 tests the seed-level difference in degradation:

```text
fixed-dyad degradation - partner-varied degradation
```

A positive value supports the hypothesis that partner variation improves transfer.

### Procedure

- [ ] Preserve original pair evaluation.
- [ ] Train matched fixed-dyad and eight-partner conditions before replacement.
- [ ] Use at least 75 independent training seeds per arm and increase that count
      before registration if simulation shows less than 90% power for the planned
      degradation-difference bound.
- [ ] Replace Baby B with a fresh instance of the same architecture.
- [ ] Replace Baby B with a new seed.
- [ ] Replace Baby B with a different architecture.
- [ ] Prevent access to the original Baby B ledger.
- [ ] Measure zero-shot performance.
- [ ] Permit bounded adaptation and measure recovery.
- [ ] Test whether ledger-predicted meanings accelerate adaptation.

### Results

| Training / partner condition | Planned seeds | Invalid seeds | Valid seeds | Zero-shot success | Adapted success | Episodes to recover |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Fixed dyad / original | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` |
| Fixed dyad / new seed | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` |
| Eight-partner training / held-in partner mean | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` |
| Eight-partner training / new seed | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` |
| Fixed dyad / fresh untrained | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` |
| Fixed dyad / different architecture | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` | `TBD` |

**Status:** Not started

**Depends on:** E31

**Purpose:** Test whether language changes when interests become partially conflicting.
