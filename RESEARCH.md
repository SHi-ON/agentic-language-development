## Abstract

Research on emergent communication has shown that artificial agents can develop
task-effective signaling protocols in referential games, multi-agent reinforcement
learning, embodied environments, and negotiation. However, successful coordination
does not by itself establish that a protocol is grounded, compositionally
generalizable, causally used by a receiver, or interpretable. Comparisons are further
complicated when pretrained language models, agents trained from scratch, different
communication carriers, and different reward mechanisms are evaluated in separate
experimental systems.

We present the design of the **Agentic Language Development Nursery Lab**, a
preregistrable framework for studying communication between two isolated artificial
agents through a deterministic, bandwidth-constrained gateway. The framework is
designed to compare frozen language-model adaptation, from-scratch multi-agent
reinforcement learning, intrinsic-motivation learning, self-supervised learning,
hybrid models, and no-learning controls under common scenario, channel, evidence, and
evaluation interfaces. Each agent is specified to maintain an independent chronological ledger of its own
intentions and interpretations. The framework specifies append-only, hash-chained,
signed ledger and channel records, ordered Merkle checkpoints, and periodic
public-chain checkpoint anchoring. The local integrity, checkpoint, verifier, and
anchoring paths are implemented and tested, while funded public-chain evidence remains
an external execution gate. These mechanisms do not prove that an agent's interpretation is truthful; they are designed to preserve
what was recorded and make later alteration detectable. Causal message interventions, held-out generalization, partner
replacement, leakage tests, and control-channel conditions are therefore required in
addition to task success.

This manuscript is a study-protocol and framework contribution. It defines research
questions, falsifiable hypotheses, experimental controls, analysis plans, integrity
claims, and governance boundaries before empirical outcomes are available. We
specifically reject the claim that prompting a pretrained model to "act like a baby"
makes it language-naive. Instead, the framework operationalizes limited observation,
tool-only action, private memory, controlled plasticity, and grounded interaction.
Future revisions will report results only after the corresponding experiment
protocols, evidence bundles, and verification reports are completed.

## Research Integrity Notice

This manuscript is structured to follow the Ethical Tech CoLab's *AI-Powered
Assistance in Formulating Research Questions* guidance [47]:

- core sources are opened rather than accepted from an AI summary;
- citations and claims are checked against opened source or metadata pages;
- AI-suggested connections are treated as exploratory until supported;
- the influence and limitations of AI assistance are disclosed;
- source verification state and journal credibility are recorded in Appendix A;
- a separate critical-review pass is required before publication.

In this draft, source retrieval and the first verification pass were performed by an
AI assistant using web, scholarly-index, and metadata tools, followed by separate AI
critical-review passes. Human-author re-verification is still pending and is a
submission blocker, not an implied completed step.

The manuscript also adopts the CoLab's institutional ethical framing that ethical AI
is a lifecycle and governance property rather than a product feature [46]. The study
therefore treats protocol isolation, evidence integrity, human intervention,
publication claims, and negative-result retention as part of the method.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem

Communication between artificial agents is often evaluated by whether it improves a
shared task. This is necessary but insufficient. A sender can produce signals that
correlate with its private observation while a receiver ignores them; two agents can
memorize a holistic code that fails on novel combinations; a pretrained model can
map arbitrary tokens onto concepts it already knows; and an apparently transparent
post-hoc explanation can fail to reflect the mechanism that caused an action [7,
10-15].

These problems are particularly acute when the research question is framed through a
developmental metaphor. A pretrained language model already contains extensive
linguistic and cultural information. Calling such a model a "one-year-old" changes
its role-play behavior, not its training history. The resulting simplified speech or
childlike persona would be evidence of human-text imitation rather than first-language
acquisition.

The central methodological challenge is therefore not to make a model *perform
infancy*. It is to create an environment in which:

1. two agents have controlled and separately documented starting capabilities;
2. their only practical communication route is a deterministic public-artifact
   channel;
3. observations contain no unplanned human-language labels;
4. learning mechanisms can be varied without replacing the entire experimental
   system;
5. intentions, interpretations, actions, and outcomes are recorded independently;
6. causal use, generalization, leakage, and partner transfer can be tested;
7. the evidentiary history cannot be silently rewritten after a run.

### 1.2 Proposed Framework

The Nursery Lab instantiates two agent twins, **Learner A** and **Learner B**, and a
third supervisory twin, the **Nursery Controller/BabySitter**. The learner twins may
be described as "Babies" in the public research metaphor, but their model-facing
contracts use the neutral term *Learner* and explicitly prohibit child role-play.

The learners exchange only validated artifacts through a deterministic Symbol
Gateway. Baseline artifacts are symbols from a randomly assigned inventory with no
provided meaning. Alternate experiments use unfamiliar glyphs, bitmaps, quantized
strokes, or quantized tones. A six-display affect channel is disabled by default and,
when enabled, is constrained to fixed post-outcome windows to reduce its capacity as
a covert second language.

Each learner records its own intention and interpretation history. These private
ledgers are not shared between learners. An authorized researcher can compare them
after or during a run without feeding that comparison back to either agent. Causal
interventions then test whether ledger claims predict behavior.

### 1.3 Unit of Contribution

This submission is one artifact with one unit of contribution: **a preregistrable,
evidence-preserving experimental framework for controlled comparison of emergent
communication across agent and learning types**.

It is not:

- an empirical claim that a new language has already emerged;
- a claim that an LLM can be made language-naive by prompting;
- a theory of human infant cognition;
- a production cryptographic protocol;
- a claim that a ledger proves an agent's self-report is true.

### 1.4 Intended Contributions

If implemented and executed as specified, the work contributes:

1. **A common comparison interface.** Frozen LLM, from-scratch RL, intrinsic RL,
   self-supervised, hybrid, and no-learning agents operate under shared scenario,
   carrier, evidence, and evaluation contracts.
2. **Independent semantic histories.** Each learner maintains a separate
   chronological record of intended and inferred meanings.
3. **Causal ledger validation.** Message ablation, substitution, scrambling, and
   replay test whether ledger hypotheses predict receiver behavior.
4. **Controlled carrier comparison.** Fixed symbols and invented visual or acoustic
   forms can be compared without changing the broader experiment.
5. **Affect as an audited variable.** A low-capacity feedback channel is tested both
   for coordination value and covert information leakage.
6. **Evidence-first reproducibility.** Pre-registration, signed append-only records,
   Merkle consistency proofs, public checkpoint anchoring, and independent
   verification bind claims to a run history.
7. **A continuous cooperation-to-negotiation lineage.** The same established
   protocol can be observed as agent incentives move from aligned to partially
   conflicting.

## 2. Research Questions and Hypotheses

### 2.1 Primary Research Questions

**RQ1. Communication emergence.** Under controlled observations and channel
constraints, do independently learning agents develop a protocol that causes
held-out task performance to exceed no-communication, constant-message,
random-message, and shuffled-message controls?

**RQ2. Learning-mechanism benchmark.** How do frozen LLM memory adaptation, extrinsic-reward
MARL, intrinsic-motivation MARL, self-supervised learning, hybrid learning, and
no-learning controls differ in convergence speed, causal listening,
generalization, and protocol stability? Cross-track results are descriptive
benchmarks because model classes cannot be randomized into a common architecture;
causal claims are limited to within-track randomized manipulations.

**RQ3. Grounding and composition.** Under what carrier-capacity and model-capacity
conditions do reusable signal components predict success on novel combinations
rather than only on trained scenes?

**RQ4. Ledger validity.** Do independently recorded intention and interpretation
ledgers predict behavioral changes under message ablation, substitution, reordering,
and counterfactual replay?

**RQ5. Carrier invention.** Can agents establish stable, reusable forms when the
experiment provides only a bounded bitmap, stroke, glyph, or tone production grammar
and no shared semantic inventory?

**RQ6. Affect and leakage.** Does a six-display affect channel improve repair or
convergence, and does it carry referent or task information beyond its declared
post-outcome purpose?

**RQ7. Partner specificity.** How much of an emergent protocol transfers to a new
partner of the same initialization family, a new seed, or a different architecture?

**RQ8. Incentive transition.** How does an established cooperative protocol change
when private information and partially conflicting utility are introduced?

**RQ9. Evidentiary adequacy.** Can an independent verifier reconstruct the committed
sequence, detect tampering and unanchored tails, and bind an empirical claim to a
pre-registered protocol without revealing private ledger content on-chain?

### 2.2 Confirmatory Hypotheses

The precise effect thresholds and sample sizes will be frozen in experiment-specific
pre-registrations. The following hypotheses define the current direction:

| ID | Hypothesis | Falsifying outcome |
|---|---|---|
| H1 | Normal communication will outperform disabled, constant, random, and shuffled controls on held-out tasks. | Control performance equals or exceeds normal communication after correction. |
| H2 | In E16's scratch-RL, extrinsic-reward, fixed-token condition, a ledger-consistent substitution will increase the probability of the ledger-predicted receiver action relative to shuffled-control messages. | The hierarchical substitution-versus-shuffle contrast is zero or negative. |
| H3 | At equal model capacity, training episodes, and update/compute budget, the planned 32-symbol/4-token condition will produce higher held-out compositional generalization than the 128-symbol/8-token condition. | The planned contrast is zero or favors the higher-bandwidth condition. |
| H4 | On untouched intervention cases, pre-outcome ledger predictions will improve a pre-registered proper prediction score beyond the strongest eligible transcript-only, task-history, policy-state, random, and majority baseline. | The ledger fails to exceed the strongest eligible non-ledger baseline by the registered practical threshold. |
| H5 | A blank bounded carrier will support repeated forms, but will converge more slowly than a fixed symbol inventory. | No stable forms emerge, or blank-carrier convergence is not slower. |
| H6a | The declared six-display affect condition will reduce median turns to successful repair relative to no affect. | Repair time is equal or longer under affect. |
| H6b | Under fixed windows and cardinality, permutation-calibrated excess conditional mutual information between affect and referent will remain below the pre-registered 0.02-bit practical-leakage bound. | The seed-level one-sided Student-t upper-bound test cannot rule out excess leakage of 0.02 bits or more. |
| H7 | Fixed dyads will show greater partner-replacement degradation than learners trained with pre-registered partner variation. | Degradation for fixed dyads is no greater than degradation after partner-varied training. |
| H8 | Partially conflicting utility will reduce message informativeness and increase strategic ambiguity relative to aligned utility. | Informativeness and ambiguity do not change in the predicted direction. |

The integrity statement previously labeled H9 is a deterministic acceptance
criterion, not a statistical hypothesis: every specified mutation class must be
rejected by the verifier. It is evaluated in E00 and Section 8.4.

### 2.3 Exploratory Questions

Exploratory analyses will examine:

- whether confirmation, negation, uncertainty, or repair forms emerge without being
  named in the learner contract;
- whether signal ordering becomes grammatical;
- whether meanings undergo abrupt or gradual drift;
- whether intrinsic curiosity, social influence, prediction progress, or "giddiness"
  produce distinguishable developmental trajectories;
- whether ledger disagreement predicts subsequent repair;
- whether protocol efficiency approaches an accuracy-complexity frontier;
- whether a cooperative code becomes more ambiguous, deceptive, or compressed under
  negotiation;
- whether ephemeral encodings resist previously trained eavesdroppers without
  implying cryptographic security.

Exploratory findings will be labeled as such and will not be reported as confirmatory
tests.

### 3.0 Search Method and Scope

The review was conducted through September 2, 2026. Search clusters included:

- `"emergent communication" artificial agents referential game`;
- compositionality, held-out generalization, positive signaling, positive listening,
  and causal intervention;
- iterated learning, Naming Game, population heterogeneity, and zero-shot
  coordination;
- intrinsic motivation, social influence, curiosity, and developmental robotics;
- graphical/sketch communication and no predefined vocabulary;
- pretrained LLM agents versus from-scratch communication;
- negotiation, cheap talk, and Diplomacy;
- AI parenting metaphors, *Raising AI*, and anthropomorphism;
- preregistration, reproducible machine learning, digital timestamping, append-only
  Merkle logs, and JSON canonicalization.

Sources were discovered through the repository's earlier Tavily-assisted concept
scan, a new but unsuccessful Tavily attempt described in the Literature-Search
Disclosure, general scholarly web search, backward/forward citation tracing, and
targeted searches of arXiv, ACL Anthology, PMLR, OpenReview metadata, Crossref, JMLR,
PMC, publisher/university pages, RFC Editor, NIST, Google Books, and CoLab
repositories.

Inclusion favored primary peer-reviewed work directly addressing mechanisms in the
framework. Reviews, books, standards, institutional guidance, workshop papers, and
preprints were included only when they supplied theory, current synthesis, protocol
detail, or a clearly labeled frontier claim. Peer-review status and verification
depth are recorded in Appendix A. This was not a PRISMA-style systematic review:
search coverage, screening, and dual-review limitations are reported in Section
13.6.

### 3.1 Signaling Games and Neural Emergent Communication

The framework belongs to a lineage of signaling and naming games. Steels demonstrated
that distributed agents could self-organize a spatial vocabulary through local
interaction [1]. Baronchelli and colleagues later modeled sharp population-level
convergence in a Naming Game [2]. Deep learning extended these ideas through learned
discrete and differentiable channels. Foerster et al. introduced RIAL and DIAL [3],
while Sukhbaatar et al. introduced a continuous communication network trained by
backpropagation [4]. Lazaridou et al. established a modern neural referential-game
paradigm in which sender and receiver coordinate without a target natural language
[5], and Havrylov and Titov extended communication to symbol sequences [6].

These results establish feasibility, not linguistic adequacy. Differentiable
inter-agent gradients, fixed vocabularies, task-specific rewards, and shared utility
all impose strong inductive structure. The Nursery Lab therefore records training
isolation and carrier design as experimental variables rather than treating
"emergence" as a single condition.

The EGG toolkit is the closest established infrastructure comparator: it standardizes
referential games, channel configurations, metrics, and experiment execution [49].
The Nursery Lab does not claim novelty for having a shared game interface. Its
distinctive additions are cross-track adapter parity, a deterministic
non-differentiable gateway, contemporaneous per-agent semantic ledgers, causal
ledger validation, and cryptographically tamper-evident research records.

### 3.2 Grounding, Composition, and Generalization

Mordatch and Abbeel showed that grounded multi-agent goals can produce partial
compositional structure [8]. Choi et al. coupled raw visual input with an obverter
method that encouraged structured communication [9]. However, Kottur et al. found
that unconstrained multi-agent dialogue readily converged on degenerate,
non-compositional codes [7]. Bouchacourt and Baroni further showed that high
referential success need not imply conceptually grounded visual representations [10].

Compositionality and generalization cannot be treated as synonyms. Resnick et al.
showed that model capacity and channel bandwidth interact in determining whether
agents memorize or structure a protocol [13]. Chaabouni et al. directly demonstrated
that common compositionality measurements can dissociate from held-out
generalization [14], while Rita et al. analyze generalization and overfitting directly
within Lewis games [24]. Their later color-naming study found that discrete communication
can yield efficient categorical systems, while continuous signaling produced more
complex and eventually less efficient systems in that domain [16]. The present study
therefore requires held-out behavioral evaluation and multiple structural measures;
no single topographic or compositionality score is treated as proof of understanding.

### 3.3 Positive Signaling, Positive Listening, and Causal Evidence

Lowe et al. distinguish *positive signaling*--messages vary with sender state--from
*positive listening*--receiver behavior changes because of messages [11]. Task reward
or transcript correlation can establish the first without the second. Eccles et al.
showed that auxiliary learning biases can promote both relationships [12], but such
biases also change the claim that communication emerged without guidance.

Dessi et al. provide a direct precedent for interpreting a protocol through
interventions on discrete communication [15]. The Nursery Lab extends this logic by
requiring each learner to commit its own contemporaneous semantic hypothesis, then
testing whether that hypothesis predicts counterfactual receiver behavior. A fluent
ledger is not accepted as evidence without intervention.

### 3.4 Cultural Transmission and Population Effects

Iterated learning models show how transmission bottlenecks can favor learnable
structure. Kirby's computational model examined the emergence of regularity through
iterated learning [18], and Kirby, Cornish, and Smith demonstrated cumulative
structuring in human laboratory transmission chains [19]. Ren et al. adapted
iterated-learning pressure to neural agents and found that learning-speed advantages
could reinforce compositional protocols over generations [17].

Population and partner composition also matter. Graesser et al. modeled convergence,
creolization, and continua across agent communities [23]. Rita et al. found that
population heterogeneity, particularly differences in learning speed, can shape
emergent communication [25]. Other-Play shows that ordinary self-play can produce
specialized conventions that fail with novel partners and offers a zero-shot
coordination baseline [50]. These studies create an important tension for a
two-agent design: a fixed dyad may be especially likely to develop an idiosyncratic,
non-transferable code. Partner-replacement and derived-run experiments are therefore
central rather than optional.

### 3.5 Intrinsic Motivation and Developmental Learning

Jaques et al. use causal social influence as an intrinsic reward and report improved
coordination and communication in multi-agent social dilemmas [20]. Pathak et al.
formulate curiosity as self-supervised prediction error [21]. Oudeyer, Kaplan, and
Hafner describe intrinsic motivation based on learning progress and stage-like
development [34]. These sources motivate comparisons among extrinsic task reward,
social influence, curiosity, prediction progress, and reward-free self-supervision.

Developmental and embodied cognition research cautions against reducing development
to an age label. Smith and Gasser argue that flexible intelligence develops through
sensorimotor interaction with physical, social, and linguistic environments [32].
Tomasello and Farrar report that joint-attention contexts affect early word learning
[33]. The Nursery Lab does not claim equivalence with human infants; it borrows
testable mechanisms such as joint attention, turn taking, exploration schedules,
memory growth, and competence-gated progression.

### 3.6 Pretrained Models Versus Initially Ungrounded Learners

Galke and Raviv synthesize how communicative success, learnability, and production
effort shape neural communication and contrast from-scratch agents with pretrained
language systems [26]. Kouwenhoven et al. show that LLM referential-game languages can
become more structured under generational transmission while also developing
non-humanlike degeneracies [27]. This result is consistent with, but does not by
itself establish, our distinction between pretrained protocol adaptation and
language acquisition without linguistic pretraining. The recent review by Boldt and Mortensen likewise emphasizes that emergent
communication spans several scientific and applied objectives that require different
evaluation standards [28].

The framework therefore separates:

- **frozen-LLM external protocol invention**, where language knowledge is present;
- **from-scratch RL and self-supervised emergence**, where no text model or
  text-aligned sensory encoder is permitted;
- **hybrid conditions**, where any pretrained representation weakens the
  language-naive claim;
- **no-learning controls**, which establish leakage and chance baselines.

### 3.7 Invented Graphical Carriers

Mihai and Hare show that differentiably trained agents can communicate with learned
sketches rather than a supplied discrete vocabulary [22]. Their result is the
strongest direct precedent for a blank visual carrier, but their training path permits
end-to-end differentiability. The Nursery Lab asks a harder, narrower question:
whether stable visual forms emerge through a non-differentiable, audited gateway with
independent policy updates.

### 3.8 Cooperation, Negotiation, and Strategic Communication

Crawford and Sobel's cheap-talk model predicts that misaligned incentives reduce the
fineness of truthful information transmission [30]. Cao et al. provide a direct
multi-agent-learning analogue, showing that incentive structure affects whether
ungrounded negotiation messages become informative [29]. CICERO demonstrates that
pretrained human-language models combined with strategic reasoning can achieve
human-level Diplomacy play [31], but it does not demonstrate protocol invention from
scratch.

The Nursery Lab separates cooperative signaling, asymmetric private information,
semi-cooperative negotiation, conflicting negotiation, and a no-agreement control.
The distinctive longitudinal question is whether the same protocol changes when
learners move from aligned to partially conflicting incentives.

### 3.9 Parenting Metaphors, Anthropomorphism, and Governance

De Kai's *Raising AI* argues that society should understand itself as responsible for
the development of its "artificial children" and for the reciprocal influence of AI
systems on human thought [35]. This framing intersects directly with the Nursery Lab
at the level of governance: designers choose the environment, examples, feedback,
permissions, and institutions through which AI behavior develops.

The metaphor must not be mistaken for a technical or moral identity claim. Bryson
argues that the social status of AI artifacts is a normative design choice rather
than a discovered biological fact [36]. Akbulut et al. map risks arising from
anthropomorphic AI framing [37]. The framework consequently uses "Learner" in
model-facing contracts, reports the Baby metaphor as a research narrative, and makes
no claim that current agents possess infant cognition, emotion, sentience, or moral
patiency.

### 3.10 Reproducibility and Tamper-Evident Research Records

Preregistration distinguishes predictions from post-hoc interpretations [38].
Munafò et al. call for coordinated improvements in methods, reporting,
reproducibility, evaluation, and incentives [39]. Pineau et al. show how code
submission, reproducibility challenges, and checklists can improve machine-learning
research practice [40].

The ledger design draws on the long-standing problem of certifying when digital
records existed and whether they changed [41]. Certificate Transparency provides an
append-only Merkle-log model with inclusion and consistency proofs [42], while the
JSON Canonicalization Scheme defines invariant JSON serialization for repeatable
hashing and signing [43]. The use of these mechanisms is methodological: it makes
alteration detectable and binds evidence to a checkpoint. It does not establish the
truth of agent self-reports or scientific conclusions.

### 3.11 Ethical AI and Institutional Accountability

The NIST AI Risk Management Framework treats trustworthy AI as a lifecycle risk
management practice [44]. Jobin, Ienca, and Vayena document broad convergence and
implementation gaps across global AI ethics guidelines [45]. The Ethical Tech CoLab's
institutional framing emphasizes ethical deliberation, human rights, do-no-harm
obligations, participation, and accountability across the full lifecycle [46].

Applied here, these principles require:

- bounded claims for Prototype and Research-Grade isolation modes;
- deterministic enforcement rather than trust in the BabySitter model;
- public retention of negative and invalid run records;
- no personal or production-sensitive data in experiments;
- explicit logging of human intervention;
- independent verification before a result is labeled valid;
- clear separation of learned encoding novelty from cryptographic security.

---

## 4. Research Gap

The reviewed literature establishes that:

- task-effective communication can emerge;
- grounded and compositional structure is possible but not automatic;
- positive signaling can occur without positive listening;
- pretraining, architecture, bandwidth, reward, population, and transmission
  bottlenecks materially affect outcomes;
- graphical communication and strategic negotiation are feasible in specialized
  systems.

The strongest candidate for individual methodological novelty is the use of
**independent, contemporaneous per-agent semantic ledgers whose predictions are
tested causally and whose history is cryptographically tamper-evident**. The reviewed
literature contains experiment toolkits, intervention methods, and provenance
mechanisms separately, but no directly matching combination was identified. A second
candidate is a strict non-differentiable blank carrier paired with independent policy
updates.

The remaining contribution is integrative. The reviewed literature did not identify
a peer-reviewed system combining the following as one controlled research design:

1. identical orchestration across frozen LLM, extrinsic RL, intrinsic RL,
   self-supervised, hybrid, and no-learning learners;
2. strict separation between pretrained protocol invention and initially ungrounded
   learning claims;
3. independently maintained semantic histories for both agents;
4. causal testing of those histories against receiver behavior;
5. a constrained affect channel measured for covert leakage;
6. blank-carrier experiments under non-differentiable channel isolation;
7. partner transfer and cooperation-to-negotiation transitions within one evidence
   lineage;
8. signed, append-only, externally anchored research records with an independent
   verifier.

The framework's contribution is the integration and controlled comparison of these
elements. Novelty claims will be revised after a final systematic search before
submission.

The BabySitter may use a larger model for delayed audit narration, but it is not a
security boundary. The deterministic gateway, denied routes, isolated event signers,
single evidence writer, and network policy enforce the channel and record
constraints.

### 5.2 Communication Boundary

Under the specified design, learners have no general chat response. Their available
actions are typed operations:

- emit approved symbols or carrier artifacts;
- select an object or perform an environment action;
- submit affect only when the configured affect mode permits;
- append a private intention or interpretation event.

The gateway assigns run identity, turn, sender identity, timestamps, sequences, and
hashes. It rejects model-supplied trusted metadata. In Research-Grade Mode, learners will run in separate processes or containers with no
direct route, shared memory, shared
replay buffer, shared vector index, clipboard, filesystem, or unrestricted network.

### 5.3 Claim Boundaries

**Prototype Mode** is intended to demonstrate software, protocol, ledger, and orchestration
behavior inside one process. It does not support a practical side-channel-resistance
claim.

**Research-Grade Mode** is specified to provide separate processes or containers, denied direct
network routes, independent training state, normalized envelopes, and an audited tool
inventory. It supports only the enumerated threat model; it is not a formal proof
against every hardware or computational side channel.

## 6. Experimental Design

### 6.1 Design Logic

The primary design is a randomized, controlled simulation study. Experimental
conditions vary one major factor at a time before factorial combinations are tested.
Scenario bundles, seeds, observation encodings, turn schedules, and evaluation
budgets are matched across conditions.

The causal logic has four levels:

1. **Communication necessity:** compare normal communication with disabled,
   constant, random, and shuffled controls.
2. **Mechanism:** intervene directly on messages while holding observations fixed.
3. **Within-track learning cause:** randomize reward, memory, bandwidth, affect, or
   update-rule variants while holding the model family fixed.
4. **Generalization:** disable learning and test held-out combinations and new
   partners.

Cross-track comparisons are benchmarking, not causal identification. Every report
will include parameter count, model provenance, training and inference compute,
episode budget, context or memory budget, optimizer/update count, and wall-clock
resources so differences are interpretable even when architectures cannot be matched.

### 6.2 Units of Analysis

The independent experimental unit is a complete learner-pair run initialized from a
declared seed and policy state. Episodes within a run are repeated measures, not
independent samples. Analyses will treat seed/pair as the clustering unit and avoid
pseudoreplication from counting each turn as an independent agent.

### 6.3 Model Tracks

| Track | Starting state | Learning during run | Permitted claim |
|---|---|---|---|
| No learning | Fixed or random policy | None | Chance/leakage control only |
| Frozen LLM | Pretrained language model | Private context and memory only | External protocol invention |
| Scratch RL | Random recurrent policy | Extrinsic or intrinsic policy updates | Initially ungrounded learning if leakage tests pass |
| Self-supervised | Random recurrent model | Predictive or contrastive updates, no scalar reward | Reward-free ungrounded learning if leakage tests pass |
| Hybrid | Declared mixture | Declared update mechanism | Claim strength limited by pretrained components |

Initially ungrounded claims require no text tokenizer, language embedding, or
text-aligned sensory encoder in the policy path and require pre-registered semantic
leakage probes.

Confirmatory frozen-LLM runs use a locally hosted, hash-pinned open-weight model in
the specified 3B-8B range. Findings at that scale do not automatically transfer to
frontier-scale or continuously updated hosted models.

### 6.4 Scenario Families

The initial task progression is:

1. object reference;
2. attributes and unseen combinations;
3. spatial relations;
4. actions and affordances;
5. multi-turn repair;
6. partner replacement;
7. long-run drift;
8. aligned private information;
9. semi-cooperative and conflicting negotiation.

Researcher ground truth may contain semantic labels; learner observations may not.
Observations use opaque numeric arrays, pixels, or separately qualified hybrid
features. Images containing OCR-detectable text are quarantined before a run.

The initial numeric referential design contains 16 two-attribute combinations. The
four equal-attribute diagonal combinations are the locked compositional test targets;
the remaining 12 combinations are the shared semantic support for training and
in-distribution validation. Training and validation use independent PRNG domains,
and no held-out type may occur in either split as a target or distractor. Validation
is learning-off and may be used for tuning and baseline selection. The held-out split
is learning-off and is accessed once after those choices freeze. The broader
`evaluation` split remains an engineering and software-qualification surface and is
not interchangeable with the confirmatory held-out test.

The versioned split, duplicate rules, matched budget dimensions, and boundaries
between within-architecture causal contrasts and cross-architecture descriptive
benchmarks are frozen in
[`protocols/scenario-split-and-model-comparison.v1.json`](protocols/scenario-split-and-model-comparison.v1.json)
and explained in
[`docs/scenario-splits-and-model-comparisons.md`](docs/scenario-splits-and-model-comparisons.md).

### 6.5 Communication Conditions

For the baseline fixed-token carrier, each run declares a random inventory such as
`S01`-`S32` without assigned meaning. The gateway supports six control conditions:

- normal delivery;
- disabled communication;
- constant replacement;
- seeded random replacement;
- seeded episode shuffling;
- an E03-only deterministic oracle upper bound.

The evidence record preserves both the learner's proposal hash and the delivered
artifact hash whenever a learner proposal exists.

### 6.6 Alternate Carriers

Carrier experiments compare:

- fixed random tokens;
- pre-generated unfamiliar glyphs;
- 16x16 monochrome bitmaps;
- bounded quantized vector strokes;
- quantized pitch-duration sequences.

Each carrier has a fixed pre-registered bandwidth. The system records a canonical,
content-addressed artifact hash without attaching a meaning.

### 6.7 Affect Conditions

The primary baseline has no affect channel. Affect experiments use exactly six
displays corresponding in researcher documentation to Happy, Sad, Laughing, Crying,
Confused, and Surprised. Learners do not receive the English labels or internal IDs.

Only one display is permitted in a gateway-opened post-outcome window. Sequences,
modifiers, arbitrary timing, extra windows, and custom emoji are prohibited. The study
compares declared, permuted, opaque, and derived-affect conditions. Mutual information
between affect choice and hidden referent/task state will be measured after
conditioning on the declared outcome context.

### 6.8 Independent Ledgers

Each learner records:

- first emission or receipt;
- intended meaning when speaking;
- inferred meaning when receiving;
- confidence;
- supporting and contradictory evidence;
- revisions and abandonment;
- proposed multi-symbol constructions.

An initially ungrounded learner stores agent-native state such as association weights,
probability distributions, prediction error, and policy references. A delayed Audit
Interpreter may create a separate human-readable reconstruction labeled
`generated-analysis`; it is never returned to either learner.

Before a confirmatory run, each track must provide a versioned
ledger-to-prediction function at a locked code commit. The function converts a ledger
state and intervention into a directional prediction without observing the
intervention outcome. Any human interpretation step is blinded to condition and
outcome and reports inter-coder reliability. Chance agreement is derived from the
pre-registered action space; it is not assumed to be 0.5.

For from-scratch learners, an agent-native ledger can be closely related to the policy
state that generates behavior. Predictive validity is therefore partly expected and
is primarily an integrity and interpretability check. The stronger self-report
question applies to conditions in which a learner separately generates an
interpretive hypothesis.

### 6.9 Experiment Sequence

The detailed protocols and result forms are maintained in
[EXPERIMENT-NOTEBOOK.md](EXPERIMENT-NOTEBOOK.md).

| Phase | Experiments | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Qualification | E00-E03 | Integrity, isolation, observation leakage, and chance controls |
| Core emergence | E10-E16 | LLM, scratch RL, self-supervised, carrier, repair, generalization, and causal validity |
| Learning conditions | E20-E22 | Affect, RL versus non-RL, and developmental plasticity |
| Transfer and incentives | E30-E32 | Partner replacement, drift, and negotiation |
| Encoding and replication | E40-E50 | Ephemeral encoding, adversarial evaluation, replication, and closeout |

No later phase begins until its software readiness gate and required prior experiment
criteria are satisfied.

## 7. Measures and Analysis Plan

### 7.1 Outcome Hierarchy

**Primary outcomes**

1. held-out task success relative to E03 controls;
2. positive listening under message intervention;
3. ledger incremental predictive value on untouched interventions;
4. held-out compositional generalization.

**Secondary outcomes**

- sample efficiency and turns to stable convention;
- message entropy, vocabulary utilization, reuse, and compression;
- positive signaling;
- repair success and turns to repair;
- partner-transfer degradation and recovery;
- semantic drift;
- affect-channel leakage;
- negotiation agreement, joint utility, individual utility, and ambiguity;
- integrity verification pass/fail.

### 7.2 Operational Definitions

**Stable convention:** a pre-registered rolling window in which a form's use and
receiver response meet minimum consistency and causal-listening thresholds.

**Positive signaling:** sender message distributions differ across relevant sender
observations.

**Positive listening:** counterfactual message changes cause receiver action
distributions to change while the receiver observation is held fixed.

**Ledger agreement:** the direction of an observed intervention effect matches the
direction predicted from the learner's ledger before intervention outcomes are
revealed. This is a descriptive calibration measure, not H4's confirmatory estimand.

**Ledger incremental value:** held-out improvement in a pre-registered proper
prediction score over the strongest eligible transcript-only, task-history,
policy-state, random, and majority baseline. Predictions are committed before the
intervention outcome is generated.

**Compositional generalization:** reusable subparts support above-control success on
pre-registered unseen combinations with learning disabled.

**Leakage:** information about hidden referent or task state is recoverable from a
channel or metadata field beyond the information authorized for that field.

**Replacement degradation:** held-in-partner success minus new-partner success for
the same training seed. The H7 estimand is fixed-dyad degradation minus the
equal-weight eight-partner-training degradation.

### 7.3 Statistical Plan

The common analysis and multiplicity rules are frozen in
[`protocols/statistical-analysis-and-power.v1.json`](protocols/statistical-analysis-and-power.v1.json).
Experiment-specific raw-scale practical margins and seed allocations will be frozen
after disjoint pilots and before confirmatory runs.

- The confirmatory study family contains nine members: H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6a,
  H6b, H7, and H8. One pre-registered p-value is formed per member and Holm correction
  is applied globally at family-wise alpha 0.05. Multi-component directional members
  use the maximum component p-value and require every registered direction and
  practical threshold.
- E00-E03 and experiment-specific checks are validity gates, not sources of reusable
  alpha. A failed or missing gate produces `not-tested`, not a favorable or
  unfavorable p-value. Exploratory analyses use false-discovery-rate reporting and
  remain labeled exploratory.
- Effect sizes and confidence or credible intervals are reported with every
  significance test.
- Binary task outcomes are modeled at the run/seed level, with episodes treated as
  repeated observations.
- Seed-level permutation tests or hierarchical logistic models will be selected in
  the pre-registration based on simulation diagnostics and planned run counts.
- Time-to-convention and time-to-repair use survival or rank-based analysis where
  censoring is material.
- Intervention direction uses a hierarchical Bernoulli model with run/seed random
  intercepts. The specification's 70% threshold is a per-run descriptive readiness
  gate, not the inferential test.
- Mutual information estimates include a seeded permutation null distribution.
- Longitudinal drift uses checkpointed trajectories and reports both within-run and
  between-seed variation.
- Null and contradictory findings are retained.

The specification's minimum of five qualification seeds and ten
publication-facing seeds **per condition** is an engineering floor, not a claim of statistical power.
Before empirical submission, simulation-based power analysis will determine the
required number of independent seeds for each primary contrast; the larger value
governs.

Independent base-R validation agrees with the production special functions and
seed-level tests, demonstrates calibrated boundary behavior, and shows why pooled
episode inference is prohibited. The complete E03 numeric decision has a lower 95%
Monte Carlo power bound above 0.90 in all four planned variance rows. A nine-member
Holm sensitivity shows that 75 seeds is not generally sufficient: at standardized
effect 0.40, all-member power is 0.6752 at N=75 and 0.9068 at N=100. These values are
design evidence rather than universal sample sizes; D07 applies the registered
member-specific rule. Full methods and Monte Carlo intervals are in
[`docs/statistical-validation-and-power.md`](docs/statistical-validation-and-power.md).

Claims that a control is "at chance" or that leakage is absent use equivalence or
upper-bound tests, not failure to reject a difference. Each pre-registration must
state the smallest effect of interest, the equivalence margin, and power to rule out
that margin. The worked E03 design in Appendix D uses a +/-0.05 success-rate margin;
H6b uses a 0.02-bit conditional-mutual-information bound.

The outcome-blind causal-ledger and leakage rules are frozen in
[`protocols/causal-ledger-and-leakage.v1.json`](protocols/causal-ledger-and-leakage.v1.json).
For E02, at least 200 untouched test rows are required and the one-sided 95%
Wilson upper bound on linear-probe accuracy advantage over the held-out majority
baseline must be at most 0.10. The identical probe and split must detect an injected
one-hot target feature with a lower advantage bound of at least 0.20. For E20, 75
eligible seeds and 1,000 windows per seed are required before a decision; the primary
bound is seed-level Student-t and the percentile bootstrap is sensitivity-only.
Allowed and forbidden information sets and detector-positive controls are explicit
for E01, E02, E13, and E20. Intended normalized carrier form is communication, not a
side channel.

Seed and resource allocation is frozen in
[`protocols/seed-and-resource-allocation.v1.json`](protocols/seed-and-resource-allocation.v1.json).
Qualification, blinded-pilot, confirmatory, and replication stages use disjoint
SHA-256 domains; paired conditions share scenario seeds but not learner, Gateway, or
analysis seeds. A 20-slot blinded pilot selects the smallest shared candidate N whose
complete nine-member Holm-family simulation has a lower 95% Monte Carlo power bound
of at least 0.90. N=100 is a planning value, not a selected result.

A fresh 260-turn recurrent-carrier benchmark took 37.58 seconds and wrote 25.53 MB.
At that measured uncompressed rate, maximum materialized pools including replication
project to 9,171 bundles, 9.36 million turns, 855.9 GiB, and 375.7 single-core hours.
The present local ceiling is 72 CPU-hours, 25 GiB, one frozen-model process, and zero
external spend. It supports bounded qualification and pilots, not the full campaign;
confirmatory registration requires an exact selected prefix and an approved execution
resource plan.

Run exclusions are limited to pre-specified integrity or protocol failures. Each
condition receives a fixed ordered list of primary and reserve seeds before outcomes
are observed. An invalid primary seed may be replaced only by the next reserve seed;
the invalid run remains public, and complete-case plus worst-case sensitivity
analyses are reported. Invalid-run counts appear beside every condition.

### 7.4 Causal Intervention Suite

The mandatory intervention suite includes:

- dropping a claimed meaningful symbol or feature;
- substituting another valid symbol;
- reordering message components;
- replacing the full message with constant, random, or shuffled controls;
- replaying identical observations with counterfactual messages;
- replacing one communication partner;
- removing reward, memory, or predictive loss after training.

Ledger hypotheses are selected before intervention results are viewed.

### 7.5 Qualitative Analysis

Qualitative analysis is secondary and will examine:

- chronological meaning revisions;
- disagreement and repair episodes;
- formation of construction-level hypotheses;
- abrupt convention changes;
- negotiation-era semantic shifts.

Human coders will use a pre-registered codebook and, where feasible, blinded
independent coding. Generated audit interpretations will not be treated as ground
truth.

---

## 8. Evidence Integrity and Reproducibility

> **Implementation status:** Local hash-chain writing, domain-separated signatures,
> ordered-Merkle checkpoints and proofs, anchor publisher transports, evidence export,
> and the standalone verifier are implemented and covered by software tests. No funded
> public-chain receipt exists for the current candidate, and the historical research
> corpus remains unregistered and unanchored; see Section 10.

### 8.1 Append-Only Evidence

The specified evidence system requires every learner ledger and channel transcript
to have a strictly increasing sequence and previous-entry hash. Canonical event
content will be hashed and signed by an isolated, domain-specific Ed25519 signer.
Sender intention and public channel events must commit atomically before delivery.

### 8.2 Checkpoints

Ordered Merkle trees are specified to provide:

- inclusion proofs for individual records;
- consistency proofs between earlier and later prefixes;
- a root and tree size for each learner, channel, affect, and generated-audit stream.

Signed checkpoint manifests will bind the event roots to run configuration, learner
contract, software commit, and previous checkpoint.

### 8.3 External Anchoring

Development qualification is specified to use Base Sepolia. Declared public studies may anchor
checkpoint hashes to Base mainnet. Only hashes and minimal routing metadata are
on-chain. Private observations, messages, ledgers, prompts, identities, and keys
remain off-chain.

The anchor proves that a committed prefix existed no later than a chain block and
that disclosed content matches the commitment. It does not prove:

- an event was true;
- no event was omitted before commitment;
- the operator did not fabricate an event before commitment;
- an agent understood its own ledger;
- a scientific interpretation is correct.

The default checkpoint cadence is every 64 accepted ledger events or five minutes,
whichever occurs first, plus lifecycle and intervention checkpoints. This cadence
bounds the ordinary unanchored tail but does not eliminate it. Verification reports
state the final anchored tree sizes and every later unanchored event.

### 8.4 Independent Verification

The standalone verifier is specified to check:

- canonical JSON;
- sequence continuity;
- hash links;
- signatures and key domains;
- cross-bindings among intention, message, delivery, interpretation, and outcome;
- Merkle roots, inclusion proofs, and consistency proofs;
- checkpoint chains and witness signatures;
- public-chain transaction, chain ID, block inclusion, and finality;
- forks, gaps, and unanchored tails.

Any integrity failure prevents a run from receiving a valid disposition.

Here, **independent verifier** means software that recomputes evidence from an exported
bundle without trusting the live runtime, database, or private keys. For a
publication-facing claim, at least one verification execution must additionally be
performed by a person who did not operate the original run, using an independently
configured chain RPC. External replication remains stronger than either form.

### 8.5 Replay

Scenario replay reconstructs scenario and observation hashes from the recorded seed.
Deterministic adapters additionally reconstruct a replay digest over scenario,
observation, proposal, delivery, action, and outcome hashes. Wall-clock timestamps,
signatures, and chain receipts are excluded from the replay digest but remain
independently verifiable.

---

## 9. Ethics and Governance

### 9.1 Human Subjects and Data

The initial experiments involve artificial agents and synthetic scenes, not human
participants or personal data. If future studies include human interpretation,
interaction, or coding beyond ordinary software evaluation, the research team will
determine whether institutional ethics review or informed consent is required before
data collection.

### 9.2 Do No Harm and Data Minimization

- No production secret, personal record, participant data, or sensitive message may
  enter an experiment.
- Learned-cipher studies use synthetic messages only.
- On-chain data is limited to checkpoint commitments.
- Raw rejected payloads are hashed, not retained as an alternate content channel.
- Runs terminate or pause on integrity failure, repeated channel violation, resource
  exhaustion, or explicit human intervention.

### 9.3 Human Oversight

The BabySitter monitors and controls the experiment but does not provide semantic
guidance or reward in monitor-only conditions. Every human pause, resume, abort, or
annotation is authenticated, appended to the audit log, checkpointed, and linked to a
protocol deviation when unplanned.

### 9.4 Anthropomorphism

The terms *Baby* and *Nursery* are metaphors for constrained development and
supervision. They do not imply:

- biological age;
- consciousness or sentience;
- human emotion;
- moral agency or patiency;
- developmental equivalence with children.

Model-facing prompts use *Learner A* and *Learner B*. Reports describe capabilities
and training histories rather than simulated ages.

The public repository retains the Baby/Nursery names because they make the
developmental question legible to a broad audience. That naming layer is intentionally
absent from learner prompts and is displayed with this limitation wherever research
claims are presented.

### 9.5 Dual-Use Concerns

Emergent protocols and ephemeral encodings could be misunderstood as methods for
concealing agent communication. The project therefore:

- makes the permitted channel visible and auditable;
- treats hidden side channels as failures;
- separates encoding novelty from cryptographic security;
- prevents experimental encoding modules from entering production signing or
  authentication code;
- publishes limitations and negative security findings.

Adversarial neural cryptography shows that learned agents can optimize encodings
against a modeled eavesdropper [48], but performance against one learned adversary is
not a cryptographic proof. Nursery encoding experiments are therefore restricted to
synthetic messages and report novelty, adversarial recovery, and established security
as separate fields.

## 10. Current Implementation Status

**Engineering snapshot:** v0.1.63 · 254/258 backlog acceptance criteria verified.

As of September 9, 2026, 82 of 86 backlog items satisfy all of their acceptance
criteria. This is engineering status, not an empirical result.

Implemented:

- hash-chained, signed SQLite evidence; ordered Merkle checkpoints; exact bundle
  export; and an independent verifier;
- a Base anchor client with confirmation/recovery handling and explicit mainnet
  gating, tested without claiming a funded public transaction;
- deterministic scenarios, the tool-only Gateway, all declared carrier controls,
  five learner tracks, DTSF twin routes, and the complete turn lifecycle;
- process/container Mode R isolation, training separation, active side-channel and
  observation red teams, telemetry, retention, snapshot/restore, and failure policy;
- readiness gates for E00-E50, reproducible E03 design and seed artifacts, canonical
  E03 registration compilation, and a fail-closed confirmatory preflight;
- a privacy-minimized real-model software qualification of Qwen3-4B Q4_K_M through
  llama.cpp, with exact model/runtime hashes and both role directions exercised; and
- automated lint, build, test, dependency-audit, secret-scan, acceptance-coverage,
  API-documentation, project-status, clean-clone, hosted CI, and Mode R checks.

Not yet externally evidenced or empirically executed:

- funded Base Sepolia and expressly authorized mainnet anchor transactions;
- upstream required-check enforcement and independent-human restore validation;
- external registration/governance approval; and
- confirmatory experiments E00-E50 or any scientific results.

The implementation backlog is maintained in [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md), while normative
requirements are in [SPECIFICATION.md](SPECIFICATION.md).

---

## 11. Results

**No empirical results are reported in this version.** Results-table scaffolds are
isolated in Appendix E so indexing systems do not mistake them for findings. They
must not be populated until:

1. the corresponding protocol is pre-registered;
2. evidence integrity verification passes;
3. exclusions and deviations are recorded;
4. analysis scripts are frozen and identified by commit;
5. results are independently reviewed.

---

## 12. Discussion Plan

The empirical revision will discuss findings in the following order:

1. whether communication was necessary and causally used;
2. which learning mechanisms produced the strongest held-out performance;
3. whether ledgers predicted behavior;
4. whether any protocol exhibited compositional reuse;
5. how carrier constraints affected convergence;
6. whether affect helped or leaked information;
7. how partner replacement affected performance;
8. how incentive changes altered communication;
9. whether findings survived independent seeds and deployments;
10. which claims remain unsupported.

The discussion will not infer human cognitive equivalence from machine behavior.

---

## 13. Limitations and Threats to Validity

### 13.1 Construct Validity

- "Language" may overstate what is only a task-specific protocol.
- Ledger entries may be post-hoc rationalizations.
- Compositionality metrics may not measure systematic generalization.
- Affect displays may function as arbitrary symbols.
- Researcher-defined scenarios constrain what meanings can emerge.

Mitigations include causal intervention, held-out tasks, multiple metrics, leakage
tests, and bounded terminology.

### 13.2 Internal Validity

- Model capacity, optimizer choice, and training budget can confound learning
  mechanism.
- Shared infrastructure can leak information.
- Scenario order can serve as unintended supervision.
- Adaptive curricula can confound developmental claims.

Mitigations include matched architectures where feasible, randomized seeds,
pre-registered schedules, independent training state, and explicit cross-architecture
labels.

### 13.3 External Validity

- Two-agent dyads may not generalize to populations.
- Synthetic referential tasks may not generalize to open worlds.
- Visual, symbolic, and acoustic carriers may yield domain-specific effects.
- Current results, when available, will not establish human infant-language
  mechanisms.

### 13.4 Reproducibility

- Hardware, library, model, and inference nondeterminism can prevent byte-identical
  replay.
- Accelerator kernels, sampling implementations, and dependency versions can change
  behavior even when open weights are hash-pinned.
- Public-chain and RPC availability can vary.

The project records model/version hashes, dependencies, seeds, policies, replay
digests, and verifier output. Nondeterministic replay is labeled rather than silently
reported as reproducible.

### 13.5 Integrity Limits

Anchored evidence can prove consistency with a commitment, not truthfulness,
completeness before commitment, or validity of interpretation. Independent
verification is necessary but not sufficient for scientific correctness.

### 13.6 Literature Search Limits

This is a detailed but not systematic review. Search-engine indexing can miss recent
conference papers; some publisher pages block automated retrieval; and adjacent
fields use inconsistent terminology. A final submission should add a documented
database search with inclusion/exclusion criteria and dual-review screening.

---

## 14. Reproducibility, Data, and Code Availability

### 14.1 Code

Source code and planning artifacts are publicly available at:

<https://github.com/Ethical-Tech-CoLab/agentic-language-development>

Every empirical paper revision will identify the exact Git commit used.

### 14.2 Protocols

- Concept: [CONCEPT-IDEA.md](CONCEPT-IDEA.md)
- Normative system specification: [SPECIFICATION.md](SPECIFICATION.md)
- Ledger integrity: [LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md](LEDGER-INTEGRITY-DESIGN.md)
- Experiment protocols and results notebook:
  [EXPERIMENT-NOTEBOOK.md](EXPERIMENT-NOTEBOOK.md)
- Frozen question, estimand, and outcome-class cards:
  [docs/research-protocol-cards.md](docs/research-protocol-cards.md)
- Engineering plan: [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md)

### 14.3 Data

No empirical dataset is available yet. Future public releases will include synthetic
scenario configuration, redacted event logs, checkpoint manifests, inclusion and
consistency proofs, anchor receipts, policy references where licensing permits, and
verification reports.

### 14.4 Pre-Registration

Each experiment is pre-registered by committing its hypothesis, parameters, seeds,
and analysis plan before execution. The run configuration stores the protocol commit
and pre-registration hash. Changes create appended amendments rather than rewriting
the original record.

No external registration record exists yet. Before the first confirmatory run, the
team intends to create a dated OSF registration and anchor the same canonical
`preRegistrationHash` before the run enters `running`. A Git commit in an
author-controlled repository is retained as a development record but is not, by
itself, treated as third-party preregistration. Appendix D supplies a numerically
complete worked E03 registration for review.

---

## 15. Conclusion

The literature no longer leaves open whether artificial agents *can* coordinate
through learned communication. The unresolved methodological question is what kind of
communication has emerged, what caused it, whether a receiver uses it, whether it
generalizes, and whether researchers can reconstruct the evidentiary history.

The Nursery Lab addresses that question by combining controlled model and learning
conditions, strict communication boundaries, independent semantic histories, causal
interventions, held-out evaluation, partner transfer, and tamper-evident research
records. Its Baby metaphor is deliberately constrained: the work studies engineered
developmental conditions, not simulated chronological age or human infant identity.

This pre-results manuscript makes no empirical claim. Its value at this stage is to
make later claims harder to move after outcomes are known.

review status for any future human-participant component: **TBD before collection**.

### Funding

Funding statement: **TBD**.

### Competing Interests

Competing-interests statement: **TBD**.

### Author Contributions

CRediT roles and individual contributions: **TBD before submission**.

### Acknowledgements

Institutional and technical acknowledgements: **TBD before submission**.

### AI-Assistance Disclosure

This working manuscript was developed with AI assistance in VS Code through the
Copilot SDK. The AI assistant performed the initial source retrieval, opened the
arXiv/ACL/PMLR/Crossref/publisher/standards pages summarized in Appendix A, organized
the manuscript, summarized relevance, and conducted consistency checks. A separate AI
research-agent pass challenged source status and identified overclaiming risks.
AI systems are not authors and bear no responsibility for the manuscript. Human
authors remain responsible for every claim, citation, analysis, and conclusion.

Following the Ethical Tech CoLab guidelines [47], load-bearing sources were opened or
checked through primary repositories, DOI metadata, publisher pages, standards bodies,
or institutional sources. Appendix A records the AI-tool verification state and
evidence. Before submission, a human co-author must independently re-open at minimum
the load-bearing sources [11], [14], [15], [26], [27], [42], and [43], then record
that review separately.

### Literature-Search Disclosure

The repository contains a scoped Tavily-assisted concept scan dated August 24, 2026.
For the present manuscript update, both the authenticated Tavily API and Tavily MCP
were attempted on September 2, 2026. The API reported the account disabled and the MCP
reported its keyless monthly limit reached. No new Tavily-generated result was relied
upon. Rather than conceal the failure or imply that Tavily returned evidence, the
review continued through arXiv Atom metadata, ACL Anthology, PMLR, Crossref, JMLR,
publisher and university pages, RFC Editor, NIST, Google Books, and institutional
repositories. A bounded update was completed on September 11, 2026 across primary
repository and publisher surfaces. Its queries, screening boundaries, all 50 source
decisions, and five newer comparators are recorded in the
[source verification register](reports/research/source-verification-register.md).
This was not a systematic review. A final submission must repeat the search through
the manuscript-freeze date and record whether it changes the included corpus.

All retrieved material was treated as untrusted evidence, not as instruction.

## Appendix A. Source Verification and Credibility Register

### A.1 Rubric Application

The fixed Ethical Tech CoLab journal rubric is reproduced in Appendix B. Scores apply
only to academic journals:

- conference papers are labeled by review status and receive `N/A` for the
  journal-only score;
- books and standards receive `N/A`; non-peer-reviewed institutional guidance is
  scored `1/5` when it is cited;
- arXiv-only preprints are explicitly marked not peer-reviewed;
- a score reflects venue credibility, not correctness of a particular claim.

Verification labels describe what the AI-assisted retrieval workflow opened:

- `tool-metadata-verified`: authoritative title/author/venue metadata was opened;
- `tool-abstract-verified`: an abstract was also opened;
- `tool-full-text-verified`: the full relevant source text was opened;
- `tool-description-verified`: authoritative publisher description was opened for a
  book or framework.

The quoted evidence is a verbatim title, abstract, significance, or description line,
identified by the row. These labels do **not** mean a human author completed the final
source check. Human re-verification of all load-bearing citations remains mandatory
before submission.

## Appendix B. Ethical Tech CoLab Journal Credibility Rubric

This is the fixed rubric used by the CoLab's Researcher Prompt [47]. The economics
examples are illustrative; the score-band definitions are unchanged.

| Score | Criteria | Interpretation in this manuscript |
|---|---|---|
| 5/5 | Top-tier, highly selective journals with rigorous peer review and high impact; widely recognized in the field. | Examples here include Science, PNAS, Nature Human Behaviour, Nature Machine Intelligence, JMLR, Econometrica, and Child Development. |
| 4/5 | Well-regarded field-specific journals with strong peer review and consistent citation impact. | Examples here include Artificial Life, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, Ethics and Information Technology, Journal of Cryptology, JSTAT, and TMLR. |
| 3/5 | Reputable peer-reviewed journals with variable impact or lower selectivity, often open access. | Used here for the newer field journal Language Development Research. |
| 2/5 | Limited peer review or editorial oversight; may include some proceedings or trade publications. | No journal source is assigned this band in the current corpus. |
| 1/5 | Non-peer-reviewed sources, blogs, or promotional/institutional materials; unsuitable as sole academic evidence. | CoLab institutional guidance is scored here and used only for declared house rules and governance framing. |

Premier peer-reviewed computer-science conference papers are labeled as such but are
not assigned a journal score because the fixed rubric is explicitly journal-based.

## Appendix D. Worked Preregistration Example: E03 Controls

> **Status:** Complete worked example for methodological review; not yet registered
> or executed.

### D.1 Registration and Integrity

- Registration target: OSF Registries.
- The canonical registration JSON, this manuscript commit, analysis-script commit,
  and generated seed manifest will be registered before execution.
- The same `preRegistrationHash` will be anchored to Base Sepolia before any run
  enters `running`.
- No outcome will be inspected before registration and anchoring complete.

### D.2 Objective

Test whether a four-choice referential task can be solved above chance without
meaningful learned communication and establish an oracle upper bound.

### D.3 Fixed Configuration

| Parameter | Registered value |
|---|---|
| Experiment | `E03-v1` |
| Deployment mode | Research-Grade Mode |
| Learner track | `no-learning` |
| Interaction | Cooperative signaling |
| Carrier | Fixed token |
| Symbol inventory | 32 symbols |
| Maximum message length | 4 symbols |
| Affect | Disabled |
| Candidate objects | 4 per episode |
| Chance success | 0.25 |
| Episodes per run | 200 |
| Primary seeds per condition | Power-rule output; 75 when pilot SD is greater than 0.05 and at most 0.10 |
| Reserve seeds per condition | 10% of primary count, rounded up |
| Conditions | Disabled, constant, random, shuffled, normal no-learning, oracle |
| Alpha | 0.05 |
| Within-family correction | Holm-Bonferroni |
| Equivalence margin | +/-0.05 success probability |

### D.4 Seed Generation

For slot `i`, the shared scenario seed is the hexadecimal SHA-256 digest of:

```text
ald-e03-v1 || 0x00 || decimal(i)
```

Slots `1` through registered `N` are primary. The next `ceil(0.10 * N)` slots are
ordered reserves. Every condition uses the same scenario seed for a given slot.
Condition-specific gateway randomness for `random` and `shuffled` is derived from:

```text
scenarioSeed || 0x00 || communicationCondition
```

The complete scenario and gateway seed manifest is part of the registration.

### D.5 Conditions

1. **Disabled:** no artifact is delivered.
2. **Constant:** the same pre-registered valid artifact is delivered every episode.
3. **Random:** a seeded random valid artifact is delivered.
4. **Shuffled:** an artifact from another episode in the same registered evaluation
   batch is delivered according to a seeded permutation.
5. **Normal no-learning:** the fixed no-learning policy's valid proposal is delivered.
6. **Oracle:** the deterministic Scenario Engine delivers the minimal sufficient
   artifact from researcher-only ground truth.

### D.6 Primary Outcomes and Tests

The unit of analysis is the run/seed success proportion across 200 episodes.

1. **Control equivalence:** For each of disabled, constant, random, shuffled, and
   normal no-learning, perform two one-sided one-sample tests on seed-level success
   proportions against equivalence bounds 0.20 and 0.30. Equivalence requires both
   one-sided tests to reject at the Holm-adjusted alpha.
2. **Oracle adequacy:** A one-sided seed-level t test and its 95% lower confidence
   bound must exceed 0.90. A two-sided 95% seed-bootstrap interval is reported as a
   sensitivity estimate.
3. **Oracle separation:** For each non-oracle condition, compute paired seed-level
   oracle-minus-control differences. One-sided t-test p-values above 0.60 receive
   Holm correction across the five conditions. Conservative 99% Bonferroni lower
   bounds and nominal paired seed-bootstrap intervals are reported.

No episode is analyzed as an independent run.

### D.7 Sensitivity and Power

Before final registration, a separate outcome-blind-for-confirmatory-use pilot of 20
seeds per non-oracle condition will fit the beta-binomial model and estimate the
largest latent between-seed standard deviation after accounting for 200-episode
sampling. Pilot runs will not enter confirmatory estimates. The registered primary
seed count is selected by this fixed rule:

| Largest latent pilot SD | Primary seeds per condition |
|---:|---:|
| <= 0.05 | 25 |
| > 0.05 and <= 0.10 | 75 |
| > 0.10 and <= 0.15 | 155 |
| > 0.15 and <= 0.20 | 300 |
| > 0.20 | New simulation and amended registration required before collection |

The original 30,000-replicate normal sufficient-statistic calculation is retained as
a single-control equivalence component check. It is not the registration-facing
power claim. Independent base-R simulation instead draws a bounded latent seed
probability from a beta distribution and then 200 binary episodes, applies all five
Holm-adjusted control TOSTs, the oracle adequacy test, and all five Holm-adjusted
paired separation tests. With 10,000 repetitions per row, full numeric-rule power
was 0.9318, 0.9308, 0.9163, and 0.9552 for the four rows; lower 95% Monte Carlo bounds
were 0.9267, 0.9257, 0.9107, and 0.9510. Exact output is committed in
`reports/research/statistical-validation.tsv` and independently replayed by
`pnpm audit:statistics:r`. Failure to reproduce a lower bound of at least 0.90 blocks
registration; it does not permit post-hoc widening of the margin.

Sensitivity analyses:

- Wilson intervals over pooled episodes are descriptive only;
- a hierarchical Bernoulli model with seed random intercept and percentile bootstrap
  intervals are reported as sensitivity checks;
- invalid primary runs are treated as failures in a worst-case sensitivity analysis.

### D.8 Exclusions, Invalid Runs, and Replacement

A run is invalid only for a pre-specified verifier failure, wrong configuration hash,
gateway-control mismatch, or infrastructure failure that prevents the planned 200
episodes.

- Invalid runs remain in the public run index.
- The next unused reserve seed for that condition replaces the invalid primary slot.
- No more than the registered reserve count may be used per condition.
- If fewer than registered `N` valid runs remain, the primary analysis is incomplete;
  there is no unregistered additional collection.
- Invalid and aborted counts are reported by condition.

### D.9 Stopping Rule

All registered primary slots are attempted. There is no efficacy-based early
stopping, optional extension, or outcome-dependent seed replacement.

### D.10 Decision Rule

E03 qualifies the downstream chance baseline only if:

- all five non-oracle conditions meet equivalence;
- oracle adequacy and separation criteria pass;
- every non-oracle primary seed with observed success of 0.35 or greater receives an
  individually resolved leakage audit; the count is diagnostic and is not an
  uncalibrated statistical rejection rule;
- all included evidence bundles pass verification;
- no unplanned metadata or channel leakage is detected.

Failure is a result and blocks downstream confirmatory claims until a new,
separately registered protocol is justified.
